    "output": "Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. It represents the average deviation of the data points from the mean. In the context of the given text, standard deviation can be used as a summary of the data and hypothesised relationships. When the outcome variable is a noisy function of the axis variables or there is limited dependence, high standard deviation within balls may indicate that the data points are spread out and do not follow a consistent pattern. This can provide insight into the strength of the relationship between the variables. Additionally, high within variation may also indicate that the data points are spread out and do not follow a consistent pattern. This can provide insight into the strength of the relationship between the variables.",

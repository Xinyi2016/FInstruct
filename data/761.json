    "output": "Diversifying across factors can be an effective way to mitigate risk and achieve smoother returns in your investment portfolio. One approach is to use multi-factor indexes, such as the MSCI Diversified Factor Mix Index or the MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor Low Volatility Index, which weight various factors in a strategic allocation framework. Another approach is to make high-conviction bets on specific sectors or individual stocks to complement the diversified factor allocation. By combining these approaches, investors can achieve a balanced portfolio that takes advantage of long-term risk premia while managing short-term volatility during market fluctuations.",

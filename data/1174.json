    "output": "As an investor in private assets, it is important to calculate your exposure to carbon emitters in your portfolio and take steps to mitigate potential climate-transition risks. One way to do this is to estimate your private companies' Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 1+2 carbon emissions using a proprietary carbon-emissions estimation model. Comparing the emissions of your private companies to those of public companies in the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index can provide valuable insights. Additionally, engagement with your private companies can be a practical way to encourage emissions reductions. It is also important to consider the sustainability practices of potential private assets before making investments. By taking these steps, investors can better prepare for the transition to a low-carbon economy and ensure the long-term success of their portfolios.",

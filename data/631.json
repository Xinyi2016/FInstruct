    "instruction": "Develop an investment strategy that reduces reliance on sector exposures and instead focuses on individual stock selection.",
    "output": "Based on the analysis of recent history, it is clear that sector exposures have not been consistently contributing positively to the performance of the simple growth strategy. Therefore, it is recommended that investors shift their focus to individual stock selection rather than relying heavily on sector exposures. By conducting thorough research and analysis on individual stocks, investors can identify opportunities for growth and outperformance, regardless of the performance of the broader sector. This approach will help reduce reliance on sector exposures and lead to a more diversified and resilient investment strategy.",

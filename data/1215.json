    "output": "Based on the geographic mapping of the dataset, it is clear that the fund types have very little exposure to emerging markets. To increase exposure to emerging markets, we could consider investing in funds that specifically target these regions or include more emerging market holdings in the existing fund portfolio. It is important to diversify our investments beyond North America and Europe to potentially increase returns and reduce risk. We will also need to assess the potential risks and benefits of investing in emerging markets and adjust our risk management strategy accordingly.",

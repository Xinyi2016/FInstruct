    "output": "As per the paper and the product insight, a well-structured stress test based on the MSCI Macroeconomic Risk Model and RiskManager's predictive stress testing can help investors quantify the potential impact of a China hard landing on global multi-asset class portfolios. The first step in this approach is to define the baseline, which assumes that China's economy could grow by 7.1% over the next year. The second step is to trace the effects of a hard landing scenario to asset returns and create different contagion scenarios based on the level of perceived economic integration of China with the rest of the world. The findings suggest that the prospect of an economic hard landing in China may significantly impact Chinese, Emerging and Japanese equity markets, and the impact on a global multi-asset class portfolio could depend on the investors' perception of China's economic integration. Therefore, it is crucial to apply a coherent and structured approach to assess macroeconomic and market scenarios and their impact on investor portfolios to mitigate potential risks and manage uncertainties.",

    "output": "Based on the information provided, it appears that the current cycle is showing some similarities to the GFC in terms of factor returns and capital growth. The left-hand panel of the exhibit indicates that strong returns in the latter part of 2022 fell away much more quickly than they did during the GFC. On the right-hand panel, it is evident that the yield factor's outperformance has grown more quickly than it did during the GFC, likely due to rising interest rates from a much lower base. Additionally, the leasing factor is following a similar path to that seen during the GFC, but it remains to be seen whether it will trend upward in a flight to safety as it did further into the GFC when financial turmoil began to hit the real economy. Overall, it is important to continue to monitor these factors closely to make informed investment decisions.",

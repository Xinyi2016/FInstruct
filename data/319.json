    "output": "Modular evolution refers to the process by which communities of nations undergo changes in their internal connections, resulting in a more clustered network. This process is characterized by a decrease in the quality of modular structures due to a more uniform distribution of links within and across partitions. Despite this, the effective number of modules or communities tends to converge to a number between 3 and 5, suggesting that the network is becoming more globalized and collaborative. The emergent community structure is dependent on how different classifications separate the fields of science.",

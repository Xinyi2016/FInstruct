    "output": "According to our analysis, there is a significant gap between the TCFD recommendations and what companies are disclosing, particularly regarding forward-looking disclosure around strategies and targets. This poses a challenge for investors looking to incorporate environmental risk into their process. However, engagement, either directly with non-disclosing or poorly disclosing companies or through collective engagement schemes such as Climate Action 100+, can be effective in narrowing the disclosure gaps. For investors who are not willing to wait, using proxies to measure the resilience of their portfolios and allocating to investment strategies informed by climate change data can be useful. Our ESG Ratings data, for example, can approximate companies' vulnerability to climate risks based on the specifics of their business activities and location of their physical assets. Additionally, tracking companies' targets - along with their past performance - can provide a proxy of their adaptability and preparedness relative to their peers. Although these measures may be effective interim tools, it is important to note that disclosure is likely to improve over time and that engagement with companies is crucial for generating comparable, investment-relevant information.",

    "output": "There are several potential reasons for the sharp pullback in EU carbon prices in March 2022. One of the reasons could be the broad market sell-off triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war, which may have resulted in some investors liquidating their carbon positions. Economic headwinds such as concerns around a potential recession and lower economic activity may have also resulted in decreased demand for carbon allowances and lower prices. Additionally, the distribution of 2022 free allocations could have had an impact on the supply of carbon allowances. Despite this recent volatility, the EU remains committed to its \"Fit for 55\" proposals, which aim to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.",

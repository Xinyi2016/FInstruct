    "output": "We analyzed the data from a 20-year period of 339 US equities and found that the separation of risk into a collective market component and an individual component holds across time. Our analysis showed that diversification benefits vary when investing in different sub-collections of the market. We found that diversifying across industry sectors is an effective way to diversify an equity portfolio. Our analysis showed that sectors with more defensive earning profiles such as Healthcare, Utilities and Consumer staples tend to outperform during recessionary periods. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that is more beneficial to diversify across sectors rather than within.",

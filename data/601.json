    "instruction": "Please summarize the impact of integrating financially focused ESG considerations on the risk and return characteristics of the four indexes studied.",
    "output": "Integrating financially focused ESG considerations had a positive impact on all four indexes, leading to improved risk-adjusted returns and slightly higher returns with lower levels of risk compared to the MSCI ACWI Index during the study period. This outweighed the effects of exclusions, which had led to higher levels of risk compared to the benchmark. The ESG Focus exclusions, however, showed the same level of risk as the benchmark after step 1.",

    "instruction": "Read the article carefully and explain the importance of revenue exposure for investors with global portfolios.",
    "output": "Investors with global portfolios need to pay attention to where the companies they invest in are domiciled and where those companies earn their revenue. The geographic distribution of companies' revenues can significantly impact their stock prices, particularly following events such as Brexit that impact financial markets and trade. A comparison of revenue by region for two British companies in the consumer discretionary sector illustrates this phenomenon. Economic sensitivity and revenue exposure together illuminated almost three-quarters of sector performance post-Brexit. The impact of revenue exposure on stock prices extends beyond the borders of Britain, as shown by the performance of equities in Europe and around the world. Hence, analyzing the geographic distribution of revenue in portfolios may improve the process for constructing portfolios and measuring performance.",

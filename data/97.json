    "output": "The current situation in Ukraine is one of war and conflict, as Russian troops have invaded the country. This invasion has led to a significant escalation of the conflict, which has been ongoing for nearly eight years. In response to the invasion, many countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia, including restrictions on imports and exports, the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank system, and the prohibition of the Central Bank of Russia from accessing foreign exchange reserves. These sanctions are designed to put pressure on Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and to resolve the conflict peacefully.",

    "output": "The \"hole\" in the top left corner of the scientific evolution of the top nations refers to a region characterized by low levels of diversification, as indicated by RCA values below the global average. This region is characterized by a trade-off strategy between diversification and specialization in order to better allocate available resources. This behavior is likely driven by the fact that funding is usually channeled towards the most complex and highly-cited domains, rather than being broadly distributed throughout the spectrum of scientific activities.",

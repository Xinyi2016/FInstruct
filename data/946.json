    "instruction": "Please explain the impact of the Federal Reserve's bond-purchase program on the liquidity of the USD credit market in relation to corporate-bond spreads.",
    "output": "The Federal Reserve's bond-purchase program significantly restored liquidity to the USD credit market during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis last March, which led to large discrepancies in corporate-bond spreads between USD and EUR markets. However, persistent smaller discrepancies in spreads across currencies remained both before and after the crisis period. The program helped bring the spreads between USD and EUR markets more in line, but the corporate-bond cross-currency spread still remains a source of risk for investors, as well as an opportunity. This spread can diverge due to liquidity or supply-demand imbalances, creating a potential hidden source of risk or opportunity for investors.",

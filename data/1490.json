    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the regulatory changes that are currently affecting ESG-oriented funds.",
    "output": "ESG-oriented funds have traditionally operated with very little in the way of regulatory guidance, but that is changing as regulators around the world start to take a closer look at how these funds are classified, named, and disclosed. One of the most significant changes in this regard is the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which requires ESG funds to provide more transparent reporting about their investment strategies and performance. Other major market regulators are also starting to pay more attention to ESG-oriented funds and are expected to impose similar requirements in the near future. As a result, fund managers operating in this space will need to stay abreast of the latest regulatory developments and ensure that they are in compliance with all relevant rules and regulations.",

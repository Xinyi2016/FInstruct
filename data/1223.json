    "instruction": "Conduct a research on the performance of the most \"globalized\" European firms since the 2008 global financial crisis.",
    "output": "According to our research, the most \"globalized\" European firms with revenues outside of Europe fared better than those whose sales came principally from within the continent in the years following the 2008 crisis. They also increased their profitability edge over local firms. However, European stocks trailed other major equity markets in the years since the crisis, with the MSCI Europe Index falling far behind their counterparts in the MSCI USA Index. The uncertainties over deglobalization, whether from long-running declines in trade flows or more recent pandemic-related constraints, could widen the Atlantic divide further and put European firms with more international revenue at risk.",

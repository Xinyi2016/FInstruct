    "output": "Based on our analysis of the relationship between the MSCI Fixed Income model's shift factor and equity style and industry factors over the last 21 years, we found that a rise in interest rates had a positive impact on the economy and equity markets. This was reflected in the significant positive correlation (0.27) for U.S. equities. Riskier assets tended to outperform in this environment, while safer factors such as earnings quality and large size tended to underperform. Similarly, cyclical industries fared better than defensive industries, while industries such as home builders and utilities underperformed. Our analysis of the two years that ended in June 2006 showed similar patterns, with the outperformance of trend-following factors and underperformance by short-term reversal factors. Cyclical industries fared better, while defensive industries struggled, and dividend-paying stocks and highly levered companies became less attractive. While past performance does not guarantee future results, analyzing these factors may help investors navigate changing interest-rate regimes.",

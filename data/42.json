    "output": "Using the unique data set of Argentinean firms which identifies both the domestic importing firm and the foreign exporting supplier, I have analyzed the data to quantify the complementarities between imported inputs and export performance and the adjustment costs of firms\u2019 linkages with foreign suppliers. The analysis shows that imports of intermediate and capital goods explain between 80% and 90% of Argentina\u2019s total imported value for the period 1994-2019. Additionally, imported capital goods explain between 55% and 65% of the total investment in machinery and/or equipment for the same period. This allows me to observe domestic firms\u2019 network of foreign suppliers and their imported-input sourcing strategy. In particular, I can observe trade flows at the \u201cdomestic firm\u201d-\u201cforeign supplier\u201d-\u201cproduct\u201d-\u201dsource country\u201d level, which allows me to observe finely defined changes in firms\u2019 cost of imported inputs.",

    "instruction": "Explain the existing legal frameworks for orbit use and how they complicate the process of establishing orbital property rights and hinder debris cleanup efforts.",
    "output": "The Outer Space Treaty (OST) is an existing legal framework that regulates the use of outer space. Article 2 of the OST specifically forbids national appropriation or claims of sovereignty over outer space, which is often interpreted as prohibiting national authorities from unilaterally establishing orbital property rights. This makes it difficult to establish clear property rights in orbit, which can hinder efforts to clean up space debris. Additionally, the diverse and international group of orbit users, including national militaries and intelligence agencies, corporations, universities, and wealthy individuals, makes it challenging to exclude potential users from orbital regions without creating additional debris. The relevant conflict resolution mechanisms can also be unclear. Furthermore, the issue of \"launch leakage\" has also complicated the process of establishing orbital property rights and hindered debris cleanup efforts.",

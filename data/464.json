    "output": "In this scenario, the agents are faced with a complex decision problem that they cannot solve on their own due to limitations in time and cognitive capacity. To tackle the problem, they form a group and allocate sub-tasks autonomously. The agents are aware that there might be interdependencies between decision-making tasks, but they do not have complete information on the exact interdependence structure. However, they have the ability to learn about these missing pieces of information over time.\nThe model considers two types of agents: those who make short-sighted decisions, focusing on immediate utility maximization without considering long-term effects, and those who consider long-term effects when allocating tasks. Agents of the latter type aim to minimize the interdependencies between sub-tasks assigned to different agents and maximize interdependencies within their own areas of responsibility, which is in line with the mirroring hypothesis. It is expected that optimizing for interdependencies will be beneficial in the long run.\nTo optimize the task allocation and minimize interdependencies between sub-tasks assigned to different agents, the agents can use a variety of methods, such as task analysis, workload analysis, and resource allocation analysis. They can also use decision support systems and artificial intelligence algorithms to assist in the task allocation process.\nIn conclusion, the agents' ability to learn about missing information over time and their autonomy in decision-making can lead to more effective task allocation and better decision-making outcomes.",

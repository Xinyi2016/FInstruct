    "instruction": "Summarize the key differences between elite and non-elite households identified in the study.",
    "output": "Elite households, compared to non-elite households, are more likely to belong to upper castes, have more land-holding, have higher non-land wealth score, more likely to be in stable occupations and more likely to have a royal or landlord heritage. These differences are statistically significant at 1% level of significance. Specifically, 82.5% of elites are either of upper caste or OBC, compared to 52.8% of non-elites. The average size of land-holding in acres for elite households is 0.842888 but less than half that (0.348) for non-elite households. The average non-land wealth-index score for elite household is 2.58 compared to 1.01 for non-elite households.",

    "instruction": "Can you explain how you verified that the small modeling error in the AI model was a result of the model's dynamics and not overfitting?",
    "output": "Apart from implementing various AI techniques to prevent overfitting, we also tested the model's behavior by altering the risk factors to confirm that the model dynamics aligned with economic intuition. An example of this is the exhibit displaying the prepayment response of the AI model to the refinance incentive, also known as the refinance \"s-curve,\" at different loan-size levels. By observing the model's consistent behavior in response to the varying factors, we confirmed that the small modeling error was a result of the model's dynamics rather than overfitting.",

    "output": "According to the article, several factors drove the surge in U.S. consumer asset-backed securities issuance in 2021. These included the acceleration of auto-loan ABS prepayment and reduced defaults due to used-car shortages, elevated forbearance of federal student loans, private-loan prepayment increases, and conservative consumer spending affecting credit-card ABS. Additionally, as the U.S. job market began to recover, consumer credit levels also improved. Commercial ABS issuance was uneven across segments, with aircraft and floorplan remaining depressed, and equipment and insurance-linked securities moving forward in line with the economic recovery.",

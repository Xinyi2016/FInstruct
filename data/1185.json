    "output": "Our plan to promote the development of a verifiable and transparent carbon-offset market will prioritize the principles and governance recommended by Bill Winters. This includes requiring proof of additionality for all offsets, which will ensure that credits are only generated for approaches that are truly carbon-reducing. We will also implement stronger governance structures, such as independent verification and reporting requirements, to build trust in the market. This will allow the market to reach its full potential, estimated at USD 100 billion, with a focus on supporting emerging and developing economies. By developing a robust carbon-offset market, we can provide the incentive for the economy to decarbonize, while providing investors with a trusted mechanism for investing in carbon-reducing projects.",

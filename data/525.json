    "instruction": "Analyze the given data and generate a report that compares the default probability of two auto-loan ABS deals based on loan-level data.",
    "output": "After analyzing the loan-level data for auto-loan ABS provided, we found that the default probability of two deals diverged due to loan-level differences that investors might have overlooked. The loan-level data includes auto-vehicle type, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, gross coupon, term, and issuer, which can shed light on an individual loan\u2019s default probability. By incorporating this loan-level data into the latest MSCI models, we could sharpen our analysis of auto-loan ABS. The exhibit below shows the conditional default rates (CDR) of two auto-loan ABS deals, which on the surface bore similarity in their pool-level characteristics and collateral-loan descriptions. However, the two deals diverged in default performance due to loan-level differences that investors might have overlooked.",

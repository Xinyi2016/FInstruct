    "output": "The study introduces a market regimes-based Implied Stochastic Volatility model, termed MR-ISVM, for Bitcoin options. The model accounts for the sentiment-driven nature of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAs) and uses common shape characteristics of the IV surface, specifically moments of the moneyness and time-to-maturity dimension. The model also uses clustering to avoid incorporating the unique market microstructure of cryptocurrencies and to avoid making complex model extensions to the overall well-working ISVM framework. The study finds that the choice of number of clusters and the stability of this selection is well reflected by the fitting of the resulting model. The distribution of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) over all datasets is significantly narrower and lower in mean when using clustering. The interpretation of clusters is achieved by comparing no-clustered, 2-clustered, and 3-clustered models with ICC by Proccaci & Aste (Procacci and Aste, 2019). The study concludes that the MR-ISVM model is an improvement over existing option pricing models as it increases the accuracy of option pricing and provides a better understanding of the behavior of implied volatility.",

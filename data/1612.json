    "output": "After reviewing the three scenarios for the Japanese economy and the BOJ's monetary policy, I believe that the gradual policy normalization scenario is the most likely to occur. This scenario reflects Ueda's views and the current state of the economy. The U.S. rates will remain high, while the economy grows slowly, and no further global downside risks materialize. The BOJ will seek policy normalization, but at a very gradual pace to keep monetary policy accommodative. This scenario will lead to the rise of both U.S. and Japanese stock prices on the economic recovery, and the JPY will appreciate vs. USD as the Federal Reserve eventually pauses its rate hikes, while the BOJ seeks normalization. Overall, I believe this scenario to be the most realistic and balanced approach for the Japanese economy and monetary policy.",

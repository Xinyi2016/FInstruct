    "output": "Greenflation refers to the phenomenon of rising inflation due to the transition to a low-carbon economy. This increase in inflation is primarily driven by the rising cost of energy, which is necessary to finance the transition to a more sustainable economy. Greenflation can have significant implications for the economy, as it can lead to an increase in prices for goods and services, which can, in turn, reduce consumer spending power and slow economic growth. Additionally, greenflation can also lead to an increase in interest rates, as central banks attempt to control inflation by raising borrowing costs. This can further dampen economic growth and make it more difficult for businesses and individuals to access credit. Overall, greenflation is a complex and multifaceted issue that policymakers will need to carefully manage in order to ensure a successful transition to a low-carbon economy.",

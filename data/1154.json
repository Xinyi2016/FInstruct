    "instruction": "Provide an analysis of the potential impact of the recent national house price appreciation rates on the mortgage market, and suggest measures that investors in mortgage-backed securities can take to mitigate their mortgage credit risk.",
    "output": "The recent surging national house price appreciation rates have drawn concerns from some investors that another housing bubble may be on the horizon. The potential tapering of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing may lead to higher mortgage rates, which would moderate further house price appreciation. However, the potential expansion of mortgage credit could also prolong the current streak of strong housing-market performance.\n\nInvestors in mortgage-backed securities need to be wary of mortgage credit risk and differentiate the short- and long-term trajectories of house prices to gauge their exposure. They can also consider diversifying their portfolios across different mortgage-backed securities with varying risk profiles to mitigate potential losses. Additionally, monitoring economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, and employment levels can provide insight into the overall health of the housing market and inform investment decisions. By taking these measures, investors can potentially navigate the current market and mitigate their mortgage credit risk.",

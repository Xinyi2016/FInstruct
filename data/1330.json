    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of MSCI's partnership with Burgiss regarding the estimated Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions of private capital companies.",
    "output": "MSCI partnered with Burgiss to analyze the estimated carbon emissions of 1,625 companies in carbon-intensive sectors, including private-equity and -debt, real-asset, and generalist funds. Carbon intensity estimates were calculated for companies within the private capital universe, and informative trends were identified for investors by asset class and at the sector and sub-industry levels. However, properties, natural resource investments, and infrastructure assets generally do not have an estimate available yet. This analysis was conducted as carbon-emission disclosures have become critical to investors due to global regulations and voluntary commitments by investors to set carbon-reduction targets.",

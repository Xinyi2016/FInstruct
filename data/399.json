    "output": "Extant research on the role of investor attention in cryptocurrency markets has used Twitter data or Google search intensity as proxies for investor attention. The findings suggest that a greater level of investor attention causes larger volatility and that the market is less volatile when investors are distracted. Additionally, studies have found that investor attention has significant forecasting power and is associated with more uninformed trading activity. The research is consistent with the theory of investor attention and market volatility developed by Andrei and Hasler (2015).",

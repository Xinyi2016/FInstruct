    "output": "According to historical data, value and low-size indexes have shown higher IRs compared to other factor indexes during economic recovery and expansion phases. These results were observed during periods where the global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) crossed the 50 mark, suggesting improvement in the global economy. However, it should be noted that the COVID-19 period was an exception, where the outperformance of value and low-size indexes only started after Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE announced the effectiveness of their vaccine in preventing COVID-19 on November 9, 2020.",

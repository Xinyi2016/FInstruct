    "output": "Based on the analysis provided, it is clear that developed markets exhibit strong correlations within each of the three main geographies and time zones, while emerging markets are more diverse. This indicates that the traditional framework of classifying markets as developed or emerging is supported by empirical evidence and suggests that investors may benefit from diversifying across markets with different geographical locations and levels of economic development. By allocating capital across both developed and emerging markets, investors can reduce their exposure to concentrated risks and potentially achieve a better balance of returns and risk in their investment portfolios. Ultimately, this underscores the importance of having a well-diversified investment strategy that considers both market correlations and the unique opportunities and risks present in different markets around the world.",

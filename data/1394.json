    "output": "The shock of the pandemic and the surge in e-commerce have had a reverberating effect on the retail industry and the industrial sector. We can compare it to stretching a rubber band, as it will not snap back immediately to its previous position - instead, it will reverberate back and forth before settling into a steady state. Retail sales surged in response to the pandemic, but peaked in Q2 2021 before generally retreating to a level closer to historical norms. The increase in interest rates in 2022 may also make it difficult for households to continue exhibiting strong growth in consumption. \n\nIn terms of industrial space, the allocation of retail activity between e-commerce and in-store channels has caused a period of readjustment. The sale of industrial properties fell sharply in April due to shocks in the 10-year Treasury and mortgage-financing costs, and it remains to be seen whether the changing patterns of e-commerce demand may add fuel to that decline as potential buyers try to understand future tenant demand. \n\nIt is important for real estate investors to take a long-term view and gather more information before setting expectations for industrial tenants' demand and asset pricing based on trends from a handful of quarters.",

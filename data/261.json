    "instruction": "Summarize the main findings regarding the correlation between COVID-19 cases, the Stringency Index, and world trade.",
    "output": "The network based on COVID-19 cases shows a dense group of European countries with high correlation coefficients. The network based on the SI is characterized by a higher average distance and a high correlation between countries with different lockdown measures. The network based on world trade shows a lower density and positive correlation coefficients, reflecting a common reduction in trade flows due to the pandemic. Sweden and Japan do not follow the same pattern as other countries in their region.",

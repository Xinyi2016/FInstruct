    "output": "Our analysis shows that even under the \"Lasting Recession\" scenario, which assumes a -5% short-term growth shock and -0.5% long-term growth shock to the pre-crisis baseline, the market had priced in a sharp increase in risk premia of nearly three percentage points. This resulted in a -30.5% contribution to the total return of the MSCI USA Index from its Feb. 19 peak to March 23 trough. However, six months later, with the decline of the real interest rate and model-implied risk premia fully recovered to the pre-COVID-crisis level, the valuation has increased by over 10.1% compared to the Feb. 19 baseline, contributing a positive 3.6% to the valuation. Despite a new era of high prices and low expected returns, it is important to consider the potential impact of different recessionary scenarios in market analysis.",

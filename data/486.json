    "output": "The paper presents a parsimonious neural network approach for solving dynamic portfolio optimization problems subject to multiple investment constraints. The approach avoids the computation of high-dimensional conditional expectations and remains practical even when considering large numbers of underlying assets, long investment time horizons, or very frequent rebalancing events. The paper proves convergence of the numerical solution to the theoretical optimal solution of a large class of problems under fairly general conditions. The approach is also shown to be feasible for solving Sortino ratio-inspired objectives in dynamic trading settings. The paper demonstrates that if the investment objective functional is separable in the sense of dynamic programming, the correct time-consistent optimal investment strategy is recovered, otherwise the correct pre-commitment (time-inconsistent) investment strategy is obtained. The proposed approach remains agnostic as to the underlying data generating assumptions, and results are illustrated using parametric models, stationary block bootstrap resampling of empirical returns, and generative adversarial network (GAN)-generated synthetic asset returns.",

    "output": "The WYSIATI bias, also known as the \"what you see is all there is\" bias, is a cognitive bias that causes people to focus on the most salient or prominent information while ignoring other relevant information. This bias can lead people to overestimate the effectiveness of behavioral interventions by causing them to focus on the treatment and ignore the many other factors that can influence behavior. For example, in the exercise study mentioned, the behavioral scientists may have focused on the \"gritty diagnosis\" and ignored other factors that could have influenced the participants' exercise habits. This can cause people to overestimate the impact of the treatment and underestimate the impact of other factors.",

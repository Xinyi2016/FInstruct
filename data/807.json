    "output": "The recent crisis has highlighted the importance of risk diversification in business and investment decisions. With global portfolios being less exposed to regional or sectoral troughs in performance, investors have realized the significance of diversifying their portfolios across multiple regions and sectors. Similarly, companies with assets, revenues, supply chains, and operations across multiple locations have demonstrated higher resilience to local disruptions in economic and business activity. As a result, risk diversification is now considered an increasingly important driver for revenue growth and cost reduction, alongside investment decisions. Governments and companies alike have continued to access markets and raise funds at attractive rates during the crisis, making risk diversification a crucial aspect of their strategic outlook moving forward.",

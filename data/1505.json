    "output": "The three scenarios outlined in the article have different impacts on diversified portfolios. In the sticky inflation scenario, U.S. Treasurys, equities and credit would experience losses as the Fed increases the pace of rate hikes. In the soft landing scenario, global equities and credit would rally while U.S. Treasurys remain mostly flat. However, in the event of a global recession, U.S. and European equities would sell off while government-bond markets rally due to falling rates. It is important for investors to take these scenarios into consideration and diversify their portfolios accordingly to mitigate risk and maximize returns.",

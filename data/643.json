    "instruction": "Based on our adaptive multi-factor model, rebalance the four pillars to optimize our portfolio for the current market environment. Please adjust the factor weightings accordingly.",
    "output": "Understood. Given the mixed signal between slowdown and recovery in the macro cycle, we will maintain an overweight in low volatility, quality, and value factors. Additionally, we will continue to overweight value, low size, and yield factors based on their valuation gap compared to an equal-weighted factor mix in the context of nearly 30 years of a factor's history. In terms of momentum, we will select momentum, quality, and low volatility factors based on the last six months' relative performance. Lastly, we will maintain a mild overweight to low size, momentum, and value factors based on contained credit spreads and an upward-sloping Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) term structure at the time of reference.",

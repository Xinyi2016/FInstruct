    "output": "In 2021, credit-card ABS issuance was playing catchup but did not return to pre-pandemic levels. This was due to consumers remaining conservative in their spending, despite banks loosening their standards and lowering interest rates for credit cards. On the other hand, consumer-loan ABS issuance gained momentum, as consumers opted for personal loans, which became a favorable funding source with lower rates and innovative lenders. Credit-card and personal loans were performing well, with historically low delinquency and charge-off rates, according to data from the St. Louis Fed. The principal-payment rate for credit cards was also elevated to nearly 40% for general-purpose cards and 20% for private-label cards. Overall, credit cards remain a convenient financial tool, but consumer loans have gained popularity due to their lower rates and wider availability.",

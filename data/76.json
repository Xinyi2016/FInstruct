    "output": "Relaxation time is a characteristic timescale that measures how quickly individuals mix into the wealth distribution. It is naturally measured in years and can be used to compare different time periods and economies. The relationship between relaxation time and mobility is intuitive, with short relaxation times indicating high wealth mobility and strong mixing, while slow relaxation times indicate low mobility and weak mixing. When the mixing time is infinite, wealth is not a mixing observable, but this does not mean that there is no mobility. A similar measure based on wealth transition matrices was studied in (Shorrocks, 1978).",

    "output": "The GBF outlines four overarching goals for conserving and restoring biodiversity and natural ecosystems by 2050 and 23 specific targets for action this decade. The GBF could lead to more development aid as well as blended capital earmarked for conservation. It aims to mobilize at least USD 200 billion a year globally for conservation by 2030 from both public and private sources, with the goal of reaching USD 700 billion a year by midcentury. The mechanism envisions countries receiving compensation for designating biodiversity-rich areas for protection. The GBF calls for farmland, fisheries and forests to be managed sustainably and for countries to reduce pollution and its negative impacts from all sources this decade to levels not harmful to biodiversity. The provisions could increase pressure on the agriculture, chemicals, mining or oil and gas industries, for example, to develop more overarching programs for toxic-waste management and disposal.",

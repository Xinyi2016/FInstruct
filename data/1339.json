    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the income risk associated with our real estate investments and the potential impact of rising inflation and interest rates.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that our PEPFI constituent funds have a high exposure to companies with lower default risk, as indicated by their higher-than-average INCANS Global Scores. The company with the highest rental-income exposure has relatively low risk of default, while the grocery-store company with the second-highest remaining income exposure also has reasonably strong covenants. However, we do have some concern about the industrials company to the left of the left-hand chart, due to its significant income exposure and relatively weak covenants. In an environment of rising inflation and interest rates, it's important that we continually monitor our income risk and understand the economic exposure behind our returns, as there may be a higher risk of tenant default on rental payments. We should also consider going beyond aggregate-portfolio analysis to identify concentrations of risk tied to geographies, tenant industries and individual companies across our holding structures.",

    "output": "The Central Mediterranean migration route from Libya to Europe is one of the deadliest in the world. Migrants and refugees face numerous risks during their journey, including human trafficking, exploitation, and violence. The conflict in Libya has created a particularly dangerous situation for migrants, who are often detained in inhumane conditions and face the risk of air strikes.\n\nEuropean policymakers are divided on how to address the situation in the Central Mediterranean. On the one hand, there is a humanitarian imperative to save lives through search and rescue operations. However, there are concerns that these operations are acting as a \"ferry service\" for migrants and creating a \"pull factor\" that encourages more people to take the dangerous journey. Some policymakers argue that search and rescue operations should be limited or even stopped in order to discourage irregular migration flows.\n\nOverall, the situation in the Central Mediterranean is complex and requires a comprehensive approach that addresses both the humanitarian needs of migrants and refugees and the security concerns of European countries. This may involve increasing legal pathways for migration, strengthening search and rescue operations, and working with countries of origin and transit to address the root causes of migration.",

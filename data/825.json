    "instruction": "Please analyze the effectiveness of overlaying a minimum-volatility approach with high-conviction holdings for growth-oriented wealth investors concerned with market volatility during COVID-19.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis of two scenarios, allocating 10% and 30% to investments tracking the MSCI ACWI Minimum Volatility Index and the rest to an active global equity fund, we found that a 10% allocation to a minimum-volatility tracking portfolio increased returns in 91% and 97% of cases over the full sample period and during periods with elevated market volatility, respectively. This suggests that overlaying a minimum-volatility approach with high-conviction holdings can be an effective strategy for growth-oriented wealth investors concerned with market volatility during COVID-19.",

    "output": "Against the background of quickly shifting macroeconomic expectations, we revisited and slightly updated the four narratives outlined in our previous blog post. The first narrative, \"Soft landing,\" suggests that interest rates will remain high as inflation comes down in line with the Fed's expectation. Economic growth in the U.S. and eurozone is weak but slightly positive, and there are no additional global downside risks. The U.S. dollar is expected to slightly depreciate.\n\nThe second narrative, \"Hard landing,\" predicts that overaggressive monetary policy will effectively curb inflation, and the Federal Reserve will maintain its credibility at the cost of a U.S. recession in 2023. The Fed's pivot in response to the recession could weaken the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe third narrative, \"Mild stagflation,\" suggests that central-bank policy will not efficiently tame inflation, eroding central banks' credibility, and inflation will become entrenched. As a result, high prices and interest rates will weigh on growth for an extended period. The U.S. dollar will strengthen, putting pressure on emerging-market economies.\n\nFinally, the fourth narrative, \"Strong rebound,\" predicts that inflation will be under control and fall more than economists' consensus expectation, while economic growth will surprise on the upside. Current global headwinds will get resolved, and supply-chain issues will ease.",

    "output": "\"Abenomics\" was a set of aggressive economic policies pushed forward by the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with the aim of boosting GDP growth and reducing deflationary pressure in the country. Two of the legacies of these policies that have had a significant impact on both Japanese corporations and global investors are the strengthening of corporate competitiveness and profitability, and a focus on improving corporate governance practices. These initiatives have helped to empower Japanese companies to compete more effectively with their global counterparts, resulting in improved financial performance and increased market confidence among investors. Additionally, the improvements in corporate governance have helped to increase transparency and accountability within Japanese companies, which has been particularly attractive to overseas investors seeking greater visibility and consistency in their investments. Overall, \"Abenomics\" has had a positive impact on the Japanese economy and its market players, and has positioned the country as a more attractive destination for both domestic and international investment.",

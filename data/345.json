    "output": "ROI stands for Return on Investment, which is a measure of the profitability of an investment. In the context of liquidity pools, ROI refers to the return on the investment made by liquidity providers in the form of the liquidity they provide to the pool. The ROI of liquidity providers in a pool is determined by the fees charged by the pool and the trading volume generated by the pool. If all trades are executed optimally through the pool, the ROI of liquidity providers in a pool will be proportional to the pool size and the trading fees charged by the pool. Therefore, the ROI of liquidity providers in two pools with equal trading fees and equal pool size will be equal. However, after taking the take rates into account, the pool with the lower take rate will always have a higher ROI, which incentivizes all liquidity to move to the pool with the lower take rate. This means that the pool with the lowest take rate will always attract all liquidity and subsequently all trade volume.",

    "output": "To integrate climate analysis into the investment process for real estate investors, we propose the following approach: \n\n1. Conduct comprehensive risk assessments: Given the increasing realization of the impact of non-financial and difficult-to-quantify risks on a portfolio, it is important to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment that takes into account factors such as climate change, natural disasters, and pandemics. This will help investors understand the potential impact of such risks on their portfolio and take proactive measures to mitigate them.\n\n2. Use evolving data and analytics: To understand the rapidly changing drivers of performance and risk across all types of real estate investments, it is important to use evolving data and analytics tools. This can include tools that provide insights into climate-related risks, such as temperature and sea level rise projections, and tools that help investors monitor the impact of the pandemic on the real estate market.\n\n3. Implement a systematic approach: To ensure that climate analysis is integrated consistently across all types of real estate investments, it is important to implement a systematic approach. This can include developing standardized metrics for measuring climate-related risks and incorporating such metrics into investment decision-making processes.\n\nBy taking these steps, real estate investors can develop a robust approach to integrating climate analysis into their investment processes, even in the face of the challenges posed by the pandemic.",

    "output": "The cryptocurrency market data used in the study was collected from Coinmarketcap.com, which is considered to be a reliable source of data for studies focusing on the cryptocurrency market. Coinmarketcap tracks prices on more than 200 major exchanges and provides open, close, high, and low prices, as well as market capitalization and volume data on a daily frequency. Prices are calculated as the volume weighted averages of all quoted prices in different exchanges. To be listed on Coinmarketcap, a cryptocurrency must meet certain criteria, such as being traded on a public exchange with an API quoting the last trade price and the last 24-hour trading volume. The data used in the study covers the period from January 2014 to June 2022 and includes both active and defunct cryptocurrencies. The trading volume data became available in the last week of 2013, and thus the sample period starts from the beginning of 2014. The data was filtered to exclude stablecoins and coins with a market capitalization of less than $1,000,000, and only coins with information on price, volume, and market capitalization were used in the construction of asset pricing factors.",

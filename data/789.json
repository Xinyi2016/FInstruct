    "output": "The MSCI GIMI methodology uses multiple buffers to restrict the inclusion, exclusion, and migration of securities between size segments. A security can remain in its current size segment if its full market capitalization falls within a buffer set below the minimum cutoff. This buffer helps control index turnover. The exhibit below illustrates how this buffer impacted turnover for select developed- and emerging-market countries.",

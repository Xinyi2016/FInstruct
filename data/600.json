    "output": "While the pivot toward petrochemicals may temporarily address concerns about declining oil demand for road transport, it still poses risks. The global shift towards anti-plastics regulations and consumers\u2019 growing preference for alternative and sustainable packaging options, such as bioplastics, could limit the potential upside of investing in petrochemicals. Additionally, the rise of recycling technologies and non-fossil-based alternatives could make conventional virgin plastic a \u201cstranded asset\u201d when valuing oil and gas companies in the future. Therefore, it is important for O&G companies to carefully consider the long-term viability of their investments and reassess their strategies in light of changing consumer preferences and global regulations.",

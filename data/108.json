    "output": "There have been limited studies on productivity growth in Central and East European (CEE) countries. However, some studies have been conducted, including those by Masso et al. (2004) and Bartelsman et al. (2013). Masso et al. (2004) found that newly formed firms had a higher survival rate than incumbents, and that the reallocation of production factors, especially due to the exit of low productivity units, contributed to productivity growth. Bartelsman et al. (2013) found that although the covariance between firm-size and productivity, a measure of resource misallocation, is low in Eastern Europe, it has been increasing substantially over the last couple of decades.\n\nMasso and Vahter (2008) pointed out that to sustain initial growth rates during the transition period in CEE countries, which was based on initial capital accumulation and imitation of technologies applied elsewhere, these countries will need to rely increasingly on their own innovation. Liik et al. (2014) studied the relationship between innovation, productivity, and growth in a CEE country and found that R&D investments play a relatively limited role in determining the productivity and efficiency levels of Estonian industries. Lacasa et al. (2017) studied the technological capabilities of CEE economies based on patent data and found that CEE economies reduced their technological activities drastically after 1990 and that the recovery of CEE economies with respect to technological capabilities is unfolding very slowly. Bruno et al. (2019) found that R&D intensity has been effective in closing the distance to the productivity frontier, but R&D embedded in purchased equipment and machinery have played an important role in reducing the distance. Filippetti and Peyrache (2015) studied the role of the technology gap in explaining labour productivity differences in 211 European regions over the years 1995\u20142007 and found that labour productivity growth in CEE (or lagging behind) regions, productivity growth is mainly driven by capital accumulation.",

    "output": "The paper introduces a pure-jump dynamics model for the simultaneous modeling of the short rate and default intensity of a pool of entities with similar credit qualities. The model uses a gamma process for the short rate and another gamma process subordinated to an independent gamma process for the default intensity. The paper tests a finite difference scheme for the valuation of PIDE for forward and option contracts on derivatives determined by short rate and default intensity, and shows that the numerical solution approximates the exact one with reasonable margin of errors. The model is calibrated to the CDX option price surface and the calibration error is generally low, but can be substantial as maturity increases. The paper also derives a market implied formula for variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the credit spread under the Annuity measure, and reports that market and model implied statistics over the year 2020 are of similar magnitude and positively correlated. The main findings and contributions of the paper are the introduction of a pure-jump dynamics model for the simultaneous modeling of the short rate and default intensity, the testing of a finite difference scheme for the valuation of PIDE, the calibration of the model to the CDX option price surface, and the derivation of a market implied formula for variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the credit spread under the Annuity measure.",

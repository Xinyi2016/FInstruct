    "instruction": "Write a memo outlining the potential impact of the SEC's proposal for GHG-emissions disclosure on companies' reporting of Scope 3 emissions.",
    "output": "The SEC's proposal for mandatory disclosure of GHG emissions is a significant step forward in providing investors with greater transparency on climate-related risks. However, the current approach to reporting Scope 3 emissions, which relies on self-assessed materiality, may lead to underreporting. To address this issue, two potential solutions are proposed. One option is to include Scope 3 emissions in mandatory reporting alongside Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which would provide a more comprehensive view of a company's total emissions exposure. Alternatively, a uniform materiality threshold could be introduced to ensure that companies report their Scope 3 emissions even if they do not meet the self-assessed materiality threshold. Regardless of which approach is adopted, companies will need to raise their standards for climate-change disclosure, which will likely result in increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders. As such, it is crucial for companies to assess their Scope 3 emissions and proactively address climate-related risks to position themselves for long-term success.",

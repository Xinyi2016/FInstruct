    "output": "The effort study measures how much effort participants exerted in a key-pressing task in 18 experimental conditions. The researchers used monetary and non-monetary incentives to incentivize participants to score points by alternating between pressing \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d for 10 minutes. The results showed that participants exerted varying levels of effort in each condition, with the highest effort being exerted when participants were paid 10 cents per 100 points. The researchers then recruited 213 academic economists to predict their results, showing them the results of three experimental conditions and asking them to predict the results of the other 15 conditions.",

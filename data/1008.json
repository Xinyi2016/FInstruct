    "instruction": "As an investor seeking to strike a balance between market representation and exposure to the size and liquidity factors, analyze the trade-off of investing in investment products based on indexes that exclude microcap stocks versus those that include microcap stocks.",
    "output": "As per our research, investment products based on indexes that exclude microcap stocks may sacrifice some of the low-size return premium witnessed in Japan and the U.S during our study period. However, when microcap stocks were added to a broader hypothetical benchmark, the investability of a total-market index would have deteriorated. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the trade-off between market representation and exposure to the size and liquidity factors to select the appropriate investment product. Excluding microcap stocks may improve portfolio investability, but investors could lose opportunities to capture the low-size premium. Institutional investors often face the challenge of seeking to balance comprehensive market coverage and investability when selecting an equity benchmark. So, it is important to strike a balance between these two factors for optimal returns.",

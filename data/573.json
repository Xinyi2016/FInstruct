    "instruction": "As an investor, you have dedicated a portion of your portfolio to small-cap companies. Use the four questions provided by the article to evaluate your low size exposure.",
    "output": "1. What is the low size exposure across all my equity allocations? \nUpon review, my portfolio has a specific allocation dedicated to small-cap companies, which makes up roughly 10% of my total equity holdings.\n\n2. Is there dilution in exposure to the target factor because of embedding low size factor? \nI do not believe there is a dilution of exposure as the small-cap allocation is specifically dedicated to capturing the low size premium. Additionally, my other equity holdings are primarily focused on other factors such as value and growth.\n\n3. Is the low size exposure consistent over time? \nYes, the allocation to small-cap companies has been consistent over time and has made up a significant portion of my portfolio for the past several years.\n\n4. Does low size allocation interfere with my investment objective or impact portfolio behavior? \nI do not believe that the small-cap allocation interferes with my investment objective, as it is specifically intended to capture the low size premium. However, I am aware that small caps can be cyclical and may impact portfolio behavior in periods of market volatility.",

    "instruction": "As an analytics provider, please add and properly model SOFR and other replacement indexes for securitized products. Use the MSCI Agency MBS Prepayment Model and MSCI Two-Factor Interest Rate Model to show the analytics for a SOFR-indexed collateralized mortgage obligation, FH 5062C BF. Also, transition the benchmark valuation curves to new SOFR curves for valuing securitized products and test the valuation and hedging differences arising from various fallback options.",
    "output": "As an analytics provider, we have added and properly modeled SOFR and other replacement indexes for securitized products. We used the MSCI Agency MBS Prepayment Model and MSCI Two-Factor Interest Rate Model to show the analytics for a SOFR-indexed collateralized mortgage obligation, FH 5062C BF. The table in our report shows the security price, average life, yield, LIBOR OAS, Treasury OAS, and SOFR OAS for FNCL 2.5, FNCL 3.0, and FH 5062C BF. We also transitioned the benchmark valuation curves to new SOFR curves for valuing securitized products and tested the valuation and hedging differences arising from various fallback options. The examples in our report show the difference between a SOFR OAS and a LIBOR OAS for securitized products and the valuation difference between two fallback assumptions. Overall, our report provides clarity on how the LIBOR transition will be handled in most securitized products.",

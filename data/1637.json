    "output": "Sovereign green bonds offer a unique opportunity for investors to access larger-scale green projects that may be otherwise inaccessible through corporate issuers. These bonds provide exposure to projects related to climate adaptation, biodiversity, and conservation, which can appeal to investors with a focus on sustainability. However, investing in sovereign green bonds also comes with risks, such as political and economic instability in the issuers' jurisdictions, and variations in the level of transparency and disclosure across issuers. It is essential to do thorough research and due diligence before investing in sovereign green bonds.",

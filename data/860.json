    "output": "Thank you for the instruction. Using the interactive exhibit below, I have analyzed the performance of the three hypothetical multi-asset-class portfolios: 60/40, risk parity, and a strategy with 40% equities and 60% investment-grade fixed income. I have noted how the risk-based portfolios performed during the COVID-19 crisis and over the last 12 years with leverage. I have observed that the risk-allocation strategies outperformed the 60/40 portfolio during the pre-COVID-19 part of 2020, and this outperformance accelerated during the initial stage of the crisis. However, by the end of March 2020, market volatilities had spiked and were at historically high levels, and the strategies assigned lower allocations to equities and corporates and higher allocations to Treasurys. Over the last 12 years, the hypothetical strategies, with leverage and a 10% risk target, significantly outperformed the 60/40 portfolio.",

    "output": "Our research shows that a strategy combining a high-conviction approach with a diversified model portfolio based on MSCI High Dividend Yield Indexes can efficiently achieve a high-dividend-yield outcome. By overlaying active/discretionary with a minimum-volatility allocation, this approach can historically lead to better returns and reduced risk, especially during periods of heightened volatility. During our study period, this approach delivered more balanced factor exposure and higher average returns than a pure high-conviction approach. Therefore, we recommend implementing a combined strategy that leverages both approaches for optimal outcomes.",

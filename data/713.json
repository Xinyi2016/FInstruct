    "output": "When investing in emerging markets using country indexes, it is important to consider the potential gaps between a country's equity index exposure and the underlying drivers of its economy. Additionally, large companies like Saudi Aramco may not be included in indexes in a timely manner, which can lead to a divergence between the index and the actual economy. To mitigate these risks, investors should consider using funds that aim to replicate country indexes, which provide flexibility to make discretionary and targeted country allocations. Additionally, investors may want to conduct their own analysis of a country's economy and consider factors beyond the index to identify potential investment opportunities.",

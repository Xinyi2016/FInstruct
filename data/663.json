    "output": "Price changes, or valuation adjustments, have historically driven equity portfolio performance in the short term, explaining over 50% of equity returns over one-year periods. However, as the investment horizon increases, the fundamentals such as dividend yield and dividend growth become the dominant sources of performance, explaining more than 90% of total equity returns over 20-year horizons. This means that over the long term, price changes become less important and the focus shifts to starting valuations and income growth.",

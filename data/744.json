    "instruction": "Conduct a systematic risk backtesting analysis that includes both the current crisis and past crises.",
    "output": "Sure, I will conduct a comprehensive risk backtesting analysis that will provide the historical perspective we need to make informed decisions about our risk-policy changes during this crisis. By including both the current crisis and past ones, we can gain a better understanding of the trade-offs between different levels of responsiveness and make more flexible modeling decisions that are critical during times of crisis. This analysis will also facilitate discussions with external stakeholders and inform our internal risk-policy decisions. Ultimately, this will lead to a more comprehensive and effective risk management strategy.",

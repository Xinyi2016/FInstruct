    "output": "Kessler Syndrome is a scenario in which the growth of space debris in Earth\u2019s orbits becomes uncontrollable, rendering them unusable for centuries. This runaway growth of debris is caused by collisions between orbiting bodies, which create even more debris. The increasing amount of debris in orbit leads to a higher likelihood of further collisions, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates the growth of space debris. This can cause serious problems for satellites and other spacecraft, making it difficult or impossible to operate in Earth\u2019s orbits. The potential impact of Kessler Syndrome is significant, as it could disrupt a wide range of important services that rely on satellites, such as communication, navigation, and weather forecasting.",

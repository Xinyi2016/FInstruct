    "instruction": "Please summarize the main findings of the blog post on MSCI ESG Indexes performance in 2021.",
    "output": "According to the blog post, despite the rebound in oil and gas prices during 2021, the lower weightings to these industries on flagship MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes had only a marginal impact on their performance. It was also found that industries, in general, had a limited impact on the performance of MSCI ESG Indexes, and the main contribution to active returns in 2021 came from stock-specific returns. Overall, the MSCI ESG Indexes were resilient even in the face of market conditions that were very different from previous years.",

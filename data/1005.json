    "output": "To address the first point, we conducted a thorough analysis of stock selection within each sector of the MSCI Enhanced Value Indexes. Our findings revealed that there was a high level of consistency in stock selection across all sectors. Additionally, we found that value descriptors such as low price-to-earnings and high dividend yield supported strong performance across all sectors. This highlights the effectiveness of using sector-neutral indexes that prioritize asset selection based on these value descriptors, rather than sector over or underweighting.",

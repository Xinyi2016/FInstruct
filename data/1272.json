    "output": "Thank you for the task instruction. I will conduct thorough research on Latin American companies' ownership structures. I will focus on understanding how much influence investors may have in decision-making by analyzing the concentration of ownership groups in the region, including the influence of state-owned enterprises. I will also examine the weight of \"Other Controlled\" companies in the market cap and its impact on governance. Finally, I will explore the relationship between a lower proportion of SOEs and improved governance to help investors assess the influence they may have in decision-making.",

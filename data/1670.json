    "output": "Our research suggests that institutional investors can achieve this balance by incorporating ESG integration into their index construction alongside factor exposure targeting. The MSCI Factor ESG Target Indexes' \"one-step\" optimization approach significantly improved the ESG profile of a single- or multi-factor index while having little to no negative impact on the index's ability to capture factor return premia. This approach was scalable across regions and countries and proved effective for both single- and multiple-factor indexes. Incorporating ESG generally tilted index constituents toward stocks with higher market capitalization, better earnings quality, improved earnings stability, lower financial leverage, and lower residual volatility, resulting in better risk-adjusted performance. The MSCI Factor ESG Target Index methodology had better risk-adjusted performance than an approach with no ESG constraint. Our research shows that using ESG integration generally improves the information ratio of many typical factor-based indexes while having little to no effect on target factor exposures.",

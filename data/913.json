    "output": "Biden's ambitious net-zero-by-2050 goal could have significant implications for investors and companies in the US. Specifically, under a 1.5-C warming path, US companies would need to reduce their emissions by an average of 65%, which represents a 224% increase in emission-reduction requirements compared to the 3-C scenario. Sectors such as utilities, energy, agriculture, transportation, and materials would be most affected and could trigger a race for innovations that would remake many industries over the next decade. While it is too early to speculate on specific regulatory measures that may come to pass, it is important to note that the demand for climate-related investments will likely continue to grow as global warming remains a pressing concern.",

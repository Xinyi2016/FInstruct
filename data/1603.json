    "instruction": "Please provide an example of how the scenario-analysis framework could be used by an investor in assessing a particular stock's exposure to China.",
    "output": "Suppose an investor is considering investing in Company XYZ, which has significant exposure to China due to its large manufacturing operations in the country. Using the scenario-analysis framework, the investor could simulate three hypothetical scenarios: a global recession with China's economy remaining stable, a global expansion with China's economy booming, and a global expansion with China's economy stagnating. By analyzing the potential impact of these scenarios on Company XYZ's stock returns, the investor can better weigh the trade-off between broad-market risk and the company's specific exposure to China. For example, if the investor believes there is a high likelihood of a global recession but China's economy remaining stable, they can analyze how Company XYZ may fare in that scenario compared to other stocks in their portfolio.",

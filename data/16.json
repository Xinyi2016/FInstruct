    "output": "In addition to banks, there are several other types of lenders that are active in the commercial real estate market. These include debt funds, life insurance companies, and originators of commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. According to data from the MSCI Real Capital Analytics database, banks of all scales were responsible for around 40% of all loan originations for deals priced at USD 2.5 million and greater from 2015 to 2019. However, it's worth noting that banks are only one source of debt in the commercial real estate market and there are other lenders that play an important role as well.",

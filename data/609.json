    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the results of the factor-based and holdings-based allocation approaches in terms of risk and returns.",
    "output": "The factor-based allocation had more consistent total risk over the full period, as expected. However, each portfolio outperformed in different periods, as seen in the Sharpe ratio on an annual rolling basis. In 2013 and late 2017, the factor-based approach had higher risk-adjusted returns, while in 2015 and 2016, the holdings-based approach outperformed. The holdings-based approach was advantageous when returns exhibited mean reversion, while the factor-based approach performed better when allocating more weight to an asset when the relevant factor volatility decreased. Further research can help us gain a more comprehensive understanding of the sources driving these behaviors.",

    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the performance of the energy sector in 2022 and its impact on the overall market.",
    "output": "Higher energy prices and increased volatility were observed in the energy markets throughout 2022, resulting in the outperformance of the energy sector as represented by the MSCI ACWI Energy Index. This index outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index by a significant margin of 52.4%. However, this outperformance had a negative effect on the MSCI Climate Indexes, as these indexes typically have lower allocations to energy sector companies. Over the period of November 30, 2018, to December 31, 2021, the energy sector exhibited underperformance, contributing to the outperformance of the MSCI Climate Indexes during that time.",

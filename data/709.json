    "output": "Historically, private-capital strategies generated strong return premia and outperformed their respective public-market counterparts. However, from January 2013 to December 2018, the average premium for private-capital strategies declined compared to the preceding 26-year period. Out of the 17 strategies analyzed, 10.6 had positive premia with the majority targeting European and Asian markets. U.S.-focused strategies that accounted for three-fifths of assets under management underperformed their respective public-market counterparts. The average six-year premia for buyouts declined, while venture capital remained stable, and distressed debt increased from 2013 to 2018.",

    "output": "CoCo bonds have become popular hybrid debt instruments, especially among European financial institutions, due to their attractive yields of 5%-7%. However, it can be challenging to value them accurately because they are a form of risky debt that converts to equity when a predefined trigger is met. The conversion feature is complex and somewhat opaque, and they have not been tested in any major market downturn. As a result, standard fixed-income models tend to ignore the conversion feature, which can be misleading for investors. To address this problem, investors can use a dedicated risk model, such as MSCI's Contingent Convertible model. This model can pick up on early warning signs of a potential collapse and forecast the risk of CoCo bonds failing accurately. Notably, a post-event measure of the ex-ante risk of Banco Popular-issued CoCo bonds failing using the MSCI model showed a 95% Value at Risk for a one-day horizon, as a percentage of market value. In contrast, the standard bond model's risk forecast failed to pick up the growing expectation of a tail event, providing a misleading insight. Finally, while CoCos are here to stay, investors must understand the risks involved and have the right tools to evaluate potential risks from this market.",

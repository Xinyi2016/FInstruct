    "output": "The delinquency and default rates in the auto-loan ABS market initially improved after COVID-19 spread in the United States due to the increased real disposable income per capita as a result of the government's stimulus checks and unemployment benefits. However, as the financial support began to taper off, delinquencies started to rise from historically low levels. This trend was driven by various loan actions such as deferral, forbearance, and loan extensions, which temporarily kept auto loans from defaulting but potentially made them more vulnerable once those programs expired. It is crucial for lenders to monitor and assess borrowers' creditworthiness to mitigate the risk of default on auto loans in the future.",

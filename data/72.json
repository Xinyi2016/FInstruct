    "output": "The paper presents a two-period model and a sequence of semistatic strategies that converge pointwise to a limiting outcome, which is also a semistatic strategy. The result implies stability under almost-sure convergence in a probabilistic setting, regardless of arbitrage considerations or other probabilistic assumptions. The paper also highlights that the main failure in the example of [1] is related to the integrability of the limiting option position, rather than the semistatic functional form. The companion paper [18] addresses this issue by proving that the optimal portfolio of exponential utility maximization enjoys good integrability properties.",

    "instruction": "Explain the concept of Kessler Syndrome and its potential impact on the use of Earth's orbit.",
    "output": "Kessler Syndrome is a scenario in which the density of objects in Earth's orbit is so high that collisions between objects create even more debris, leading to a cascading effect that makes the use of Earth's orbit impossible. This scenario is named after NASA scientist Donald Kessler, who first proposed it in the 1970s. The potential impact of Kessler Syndrome on the use of Earth's orbit is severe, as it could make satellite communication, navigation, and other space-based services impossible. This could have significant consequences for global economies and security.",

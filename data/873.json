    "instruction": "As a global investor, how can you capture the comprehensive China investment opportunity set despite the accessibility constraints of China A-Shares?",
    "output": "One approach is to wait until the access to the A-share market is further liberalized. However, this may not provide complete exposure to Chinese equities. Another option is to assess the trade-offs between A-shares' market accessibility and their legal, tax, compliance, and other operational requirements, and the potential long-term strategic value of having a more representative and comprehensive China allocation in your equity policy portfolio. China A-shares historically have demonstrated relatively low correlations with the rest of the world, leading to potential diversification effects at the total portfolio level. Additionally, compared to the MSCI China Index, the MSCI China A Index has three times the number of total constituents and provides a better representation of the long-term growth of China's domestic economy. Investing in the China A-Shares market may be difficult for many institutional investors currently due to accessibility constraints, but given its importance, it is too big to be ignored.",

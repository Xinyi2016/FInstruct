    "instruction": "Please explain the purpose and features of the MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Index.",
    "output": "The MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Index is designed to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and reduce climate-related risks and opportunities. It is in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the index, including scope 3 emissions and supply chain emissions. The weights of companies with verifiable emission reduction targets are increased, and the weights of companies at a disadvantage in transitioning to a low-carbon economy are reduced. Additionally, the index reduces exposure to natural climate risks based on MSCI's Climate Value-at-Risk model. Finally, the index aims to achieve a 10% reduction in carbon footprint through self-decarbonization. The MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Index intends to support investment products and actively manage investment strategies towards the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal while respecting other investment constraints.",

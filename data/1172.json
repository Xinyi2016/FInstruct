    "instruction": "Please analyze the risks and costs associated with a late-action scenario for the energy and food and staples retailing industries.",
    "output": "In a late-action scenario where global warming reaches 2\u00b0C, the energy industry will incur significantly higher risks and losses compared to an early-action scenario where warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C. On average, energy companies would see their loss to enterprise value double from 31% to 62%. However, for the food and staples retailing industry, the risks and losses are even greater. The average transition risk would jump from -6.73% in an early-action 1.5\u00b0C scenario to -33.46% in a late-action 2\u00b0C scenario. Most of this increased risk is due to electricity use, with Scope 2 emissions playing a significant role. The delay in taking action means that the transition costs and opportunities in a late-action scenario would be much higher, requiring far steeper emissions reductions in a much shorter period to stabilize global warming. Therefore, it is imperative that industries take immediate and effective action to reduce their carbon footprint to prevent such drastic consequences.",

    "output": "Thank you for your interest in our previous blog post. The interactive exhibit available shows the median five-year implied probability of default (PD) changes for investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) corporate-bond issuers based on three NGFS scenarios: \u201cNet Zero 2050,\u201d \u201cBelow 2\u2070C,\u201d and \u201cNationally Determined Contributions.\u201d According to the exhibit, the \u201cNet Zero 2050 (Average Extreme Weather)\u201d scenario has the largest contribution from policy risk. We encourage you to further explore the exhibit to gain a better understanding of how each scenario impacts the median PD changes.",

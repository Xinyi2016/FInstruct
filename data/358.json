    "output": "The left panel of the figure shows the spatial distribution of all geotagged incidents in each dataset. In the Frontex dataset, location information is unavailable for all incidents before November 2014 or after October 2017 and for incidents within Frontex\u2019s operational areas, so most geotagged incidents are clustered near Libya or in the sea between Egypt and Italy. The MSF and Broadcast Warnings data are also largely clustered off the coast of Libya, where the bulk of rescues occurred in 2016 - 2017. In contrast, the Watch The Med data and the IOM Missing Migrants data are more scattered, likely because these datasets capture incidents that may have \u201cfallen through the cracks\u201d of the standard rescue response, because they continue to capture recent incidents, and/or because their associated geocoordinates may be less accurate. Watch The Med often associates a single set of geocoordinates with multiple different incidents. IOM attempts to recover incident information from public data sources, and it seems they may use approximate coordinates when no precise data is available.",

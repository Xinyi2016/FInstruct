    "output": "During times of financial volatility, such as the COVID-19 crisis, factor exposures become more crucial than singular stock picks. Cross-sectional dispersion attributed to common factors increases, meaning it is essential to manage factor exposures effectively. This requires technology-enabled, timely, and accurate analysis of portfolio factor exposures at different levels of aggregation. For example, avoiding industries such as airlines, rather than picking individual stocks, may be more critical in maintaining portfolio stability during times of market turbulence.",

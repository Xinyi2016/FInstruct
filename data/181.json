    "instruction": "Explain the concept of endogenous and exogenous bursts in the context of market crashes.",
    "output": "Endogenous bursts refer to market crashes caused by the cumulative selling pressure from within the system, such as the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Exogenous bursts, on the other hand, are caused by unanticipated events from outside the system, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Both types of bursts can lead to sudden drops in price, but the size of the drop does not depend on the exact type of burst.",

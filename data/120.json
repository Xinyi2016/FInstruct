    "output": "Optimization cost refers to the reduced-form cost that firms incur in order to generate a more precise estimate of the fully-optimal salary. This cost reflects a range of underlying mechanisms, including information-gathering costs, attention costs, and the cost of integrating the data available. The concept of optimization cost is important because it highlights the fact that firms have to invest resources in order to determine the appropriate salary for a given employee. By paying this optimization cost, firms can generate a more accurate estimate of the salary that will attract and retain the best employees, which is crucial for their long-term success.",

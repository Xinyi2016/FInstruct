    "instruction": "Make a case for the importance of embracing alternative packaging solutions to reduce economic loss from plastic waste.",
    "output": "It is crucial that we prioritize the development and implementation of alternative packaging solutions in order to mitigate the huge economic losses caused by plastic waste. With only 9% of plastics currently being recycled, there is a significant opportunity to redirect a substantial portion of the estimated USD 80 billion to 120 billion lost every year towards more sustainable, environmentally-friendly options. The support of the investment community will be crucial to accelerate the development of these technologies as well as to incentivize widespread adoption. Furthermore, embracing alternative packaging solutions will not only benefit the environment and economy, but it will also align with the growing demand from consumers for more sustainable products and practices. By investing in such solutions, we can build a more resilient and sustainable future for all.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze the estimated financing emissions for Engie SA's green bonds and non-green bonds, using the MSCI Total Portfolio Carbon Footprint accounting tool. Compare and contrast their respective emissions and explain any differences.",
    "output": "Using the MSCI Total Portfolio Carbon Footprint accounting tool, we can estimate the financing emissions for Engie SA's green bonds and non-green bonds. As shown in the table, the estimated emissions for the green bonds are significantly lower than those for the non-green bonds. However, there are also differences in the financing emissions between the two green bonds, which are related to different types of green projects being financed. The 2024 green bond has an estimated emission of 16.5 tCO2e/million USD, while the 2032 green bond has an estimated emission of 10.2 tCO2e/million USD. These differences can be explained by the fact that the emissions for green bonds are calculated at the project level, while emissions for non-green bonds are calculated at the issuer level. Overall, this analysis highlights the importance of considering financing emissions when evaluating investment portfolios.",

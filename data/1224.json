    "output": "According to our analysis, the difference in regions' annual returns was largely attributed to the growth in firms' earnings. Sales among European firms actually contracted, particularly for the largest companies. It's important to note that Europe historically has had smaller representation of digital and technology-enabled firms, which dominated equity markets throughout the 2010s. Additionally, the difference was not merely due to expanding U.S. multiples. We broke down each region's annual return into earnings growth, price-to-earnings expansion, dividends, and currency components to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers behind each region's performance.",

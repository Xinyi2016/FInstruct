    "output": "To develop a mathematical model that describes the proposed framework, we can start by defining the variables and parameters involved in the system. The key variables include the inverse demand function, the level of cooperation, the accumulated gas in reservoirs, the availability of transfer capacities, and the redistribution-clearing price.\n\nWe can then use these variables to formulate a set of equations that describe the behavior of the system. For example, we can use the inverse demand function to model the relationship between price and quantity demanded, and the level of cooperation to model the willingness of participants to engage in redistribution.\n\nOnce we have formulated the equations, we can use mathematical techniques such as optimization or simulation to solve the model and determine the optimal redistribution of gas among participants. The solution should take into account the actual transmission constraints of the network and the levels of cooperation of participants, as well as any other relevant factors.\n\nOverall, the mathematical model should provide a detailed description of the proposed framework, allowing us to analyze its behavior and evaluate its effectiveness in achieving the desired goals of supply security and cooperation.",

    "output": "Japan's adoption of the Stewardship Code in 2014 and the Corporate Governance Code in 2015 has put increased pressure on both management and investors to align Japanese corporate-governance practices with global best practices. Prior to the adoption of the CG Code, there were no constituents assessed as having at least one director who can be considered fully independent of management. However, now all constituents have been assessed with average board independence just under 50%. Further revisions to the CG Code have expanded the push for greater diversity on boards from the perspective of gender, experience, and age.",

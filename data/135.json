    "output": "Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) are two important risk measures used in the risk management systems of banks and other financial institutions. VaR is a measure of the maximum potential loss that can be expected with a certain level of confidence over a specific time period. It is used to estimate the risk of a portfolio of assets and is typically expressed as a percentage of the portfolio value. VaR is calculated by estimating the distribution of potential losses and then finding the value that represents the desired level of confidence.\n\nExpected Shortfall (ES) is a measure of the average loss that can be expected over a specific time period, conditional on the loss exceeding the VaR. In other words, ES is the average loss that can be expected over a specific time period, given that the loss exceeds the VaR. ES is a coherent risk measure, which means that it satisfies the subadditivity property, which states that the risk of a portfolio of assets is less than or equal to the sum of the risks of its individual components.\n\nIn recent years, ES has been increasingly employed for tail risk measurement, as it is considered a more accurate measure of risk than VaR. ES takes into account the likelihood and size of losses above the VaR, which makes it a more comprehensive measure of risk. However, VaR remains an important risk measure and is still widely used in the risk management systems of banks and other financial institutions.",

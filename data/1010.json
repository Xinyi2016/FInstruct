    "output": "When it comes to selecting an equity benchmark, it is crucial to carefully weigh the trade-offs between including or excluding microcap stocks. While microcap stocks may offer potential for high returns, they also carry a significant amount of risk due to their small size and lack of liquidity. Incorporating liquidity measures such as those used in MSCI\u2019s GIMI methodology can help to mitigate some of these risks and provide a better liquidity profile for the index. Ultimately, the decision to include or exclude microcap stocks in an equity benchmark requires a comprehensive analysis of the specific risks and benefits involved, as well as consideration of broader investment goals and strategies.",

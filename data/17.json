    "instruction": "Please summarize the role of regional and local banks in commercial-property loan originations from 2015 to 2019 and their recent performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "output": "Regional and local banks were responsible for 17% of commercial-property loan originations from 2015 to 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these smaller banks gained market share, accounting for over 25% of total lending in 2020, before retreating. By Q4 2022, these banks had regained ground and were responsible for 31% of origination volume across all lender types. This growth in market share is attributed not only to smaller lenders taking on risks where others would not, but also to the fact that smaller banks tend to lend on smaller assets in smaller markets, which saw increased investment activity as the pandemic decreased deal volume in more expensive coastal markets.",

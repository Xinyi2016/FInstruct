    "output": "One way to evaluate your investments through the prism of climate risks and opportunities is to assess how the investments align with net-zero goals. For instance, you can consider the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the products or services being produced or delivered by the companies you invest in, and the extent to which these emissions can be reduced or eliminated through decarbonization efforts. You can also evaluate the resilience of your investments to the physical impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and sea level rise, and the potential regulatory and policy risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy. By doing so, you can help advance the low-carbon revolution and contribute to making net-zero a reality.",

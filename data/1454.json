    "instruction": "Evaluate whether investing in industrial properties in the U.S. is a sound decision.",
    "output": "Based on the transaction evidence, it appears that buyers have been pricing in unprecedented income growth for U.S. industrial property due to record-low vacancy rates and strong increases in market rents. However, there are still risks to consider, and investors may need to exercise caution when underwriting expected income growth. The e-commerce revolution has boosted demand for logistics and warehousing assets, driving down cap rates and increasing returns. Industrial allocations in portfolios of commercial real estate have grown from 15% a decade ago to 33% as of June 2022, indicating a trend towards investing in industrial properties. Overall, while there are risks and uncertainties, investing in U.S. industrial properties may still be a sound decision given the current market trends and transaction evidence.",

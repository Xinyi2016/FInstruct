    "output": "According to the article, institutional real estate investors may have less exposure to countries significantly exposed to decoupling risk due to deglobalization. Additionally, a large percentage of real estate investments are currently in liberal democracies with transparent or highly transparent real estate markets. However, real estate may still be indirectly affected by deglobalization through changes in international trade patterns, such as nearshoring and just-in-case logistics. These changes could impact the volume, nature, and location of real estate demand, potentially leading to a shift in demand away from markets that are more vulnerable to trade disruption. While the effects of deglobalization on real estate may differ from those on other asset classes, it could still result in profound consequences for asset allocation and portfolio construction.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze the level of crowding in the future-education and genomic-innovation themes compared to the MSCI ACWI IMI Efficient Energy Index, and provide a possible explanation for the level of crowding.",
    "output": "Our analysis found that the future-education and genomic-innovation themes had similar levels of crowding as the MSCI ACWI IMI Efficient Energy Index, with approximately 8% crowded stocks by weight as of the end of March 2021. This could be attributed to investors' interest in companies related to telepresence and genomic sequencing. However, towards the end of the year, there was a decrease in crowding, which may have been influenced by positive vaccine-related developments.",

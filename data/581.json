    "output": "In 2019, real estate investors are likely to face challenges due to emerging trends that have the potential to impact their investment decisions. Climate change is a primary concern as it has a direct impact on the ownership and management of property. The integration of environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) considerations into portfolio decisions is gaining traction among real estate investors. Property in coastal zones with high risk of flooding may face lower property values, while inland areas that are less flood-prone may experience an increase in their value. \n\nInvestors who have diversified globally are likely to encounter geopolitical risks due to political uncertainty. Factors such as the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum, the nationwide protest movement in France, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history and ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions are contributing to global risks that real estate investors may not be able to escape.\n\nAdvancements in technology continue to disrupt the real estate industry. Tenants\u2019 business models are changing, and this has implications for the amount and type of real estate they require. Technology is also shifting the way real estate investments are underwritten.\n\nTransparency and insight into less liquid and previously opaque asset classes, such as real estate, are gaining importance across portfolios. Investors expect transparency as they shift capital from equity markets, which have become more efficient due to index-based and factor investing, towards private asset classes like real estate.\n\nThe current expansionary cycle has lasted more than ten years, and investors are questioning if the strong performance will continue at the same pace. This has led some investors to adopt defensive positions to hedge against potential downturns, while others seek properties with more potential for growth in cash flow.\n\nOverall, real estate investors must consider a range of emerging trends in 2019 to make informed investment decisions.",

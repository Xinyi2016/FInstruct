    "instruction": "Using the empirical framework outlined in section 4, we first study how the productivity effects of (1) innovation effort as proxied by R&D expenditure and (2) capital accumulation differ between entrants and incumbent firms. In Table 3, we display the results of estimating equation (4.3).",
    "output": "The study examines the productivity effects of innovation effort (proxied by R&D expenditure) and capital accumulation for both entrants and incumbent firms. The results are displayed in Table 3, which shows the estimated elasticities of productivity with respect to own R&D and capital stock. The study finds that the average productivity elasticity of R&D expenditures is significantly positive for both entrants and incumbents, but entrants' elasticity does not differ significantly from incumbents'. The study also finds that the bulk of STI-based innovation in Estonia is carried out by incumbents, and incumbents play an important role as carriers of STI mode of innovation.",

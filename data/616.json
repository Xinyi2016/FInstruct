    "instruction": "Can you provide an analysis of the information ratio of U.S. price momentum and its performance compared to other factors in the market?",
    "output": "Based on its trailing 252-day return volatility, the information ratio (IR) of U.S. price momentum was -7.3 in the current month, which is lower than the IR of -8.7 during the four-day Quant Crunch of August 2007 and -4.0 during the early stages of the market turnaround in the second week of April 2009. U.S. price momentum has been more of a defensive factor this year due to the rotation from cyclical to defensive stocks in the second half of last year, and has been negatively correlated with the overall U.S. equity market (-0.16). On the other hand, the U.S. earnings yield factor returned 0.5% and had an information ratio of 1.2, while the historical beta factor had strong performance in the U.S. and globally with IRs of 1.6 and 1.1, respectively. In contrast, the performance of other defensive factors, such as size and profitability, was negative, but not as much as momentum. Positive-momentum stocks were slightly negative over the same period, driving U.S. price momentum's underperformance. Additionally, global price momentum exhibited negative performance in September with an IR of -4.8.",

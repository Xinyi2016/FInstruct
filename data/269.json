    "output": "The 25-year rule is a guideline for satellite operators promoted by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee, NASA, and other space agencies since the early 1990s. It asks that operators ensure their satellites will safely deorbit within 25 years of the end of their productive life. Satellites placed below 650 km are viewed as \"naturally compliant with the 25-year rule because once their mission is over, they will decay within 25 years without any additional maneuvers. Many current policy approaches to orbital-use management are being designed with the 25-year rule in mind. For example, in a recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking the Federal Communications Commission (which manages radio spectrum for satellite operators transmitting to and from the US) suggested that satellite spectrum applicants would receive greater scrutiny if their planned orbit was above 650 km since they would not be naturally compliant with the 25-year rule. If open access will cause Kessler Syndrome below 650 km, existing policy approaches will need to be reconsidered.",

    "output": "Energy systems play a crucial role in modern society, providing essential services such as clean water, sanitation, healthcare, lighting, heating, cooking, mechanical power, transport, and telecommunications. These systems have significantly improved the standard of living for part of the world\u2019s population. Energy is considered a precondition for all commodities, equal in importance to air, water, and earth.\n\nModern energy systems are complex and involve various phases, including production, transformation, transport, and distribution of energy sources. The focus on these phases has increased due to several aspects. First, research is emphasizing energy security as a key variable in the relationship between energy and well-being. Ensuring an uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price is crucial for short-term energy security, while long-term energy security deals with investments to supply energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs.\n\nSecond, the use of fossil fuels to meet the world\u2019s growing energy demand has serious implications for public health and the environment. Carbon dioxide emissions, the principal cause of global warming, are rising, and efforts to ensure energy security must be closely linked to mitigating climate change. Countries must consider energy security and climate change mitigation priorities jointly to optimize their energy policy.\n\nThird, energy access is a major area of inequity, with energy sources not being equitably distributed around the globe, creating an asymmetric world with a strong dependence on major fossil fuel exporters.

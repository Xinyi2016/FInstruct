    "output": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to significant impacts on the European Union's energy security, mainly through the implied sanctions and countermeasures. According to a recent report by ENTSOG, it is possible that most European gas storages will be depleted during the winter period and several European countries will not be able to fill storages during the summer of 2023 to levels necessary to ensure security of gas supply for the winter of 2023/2024. The report advises improving cooperation between member states and allowing for more efficient storage utilization to improve the security of gas supply. However, answering the question of how to achieve this is not straightforward due to the lack of a common external energy security policy and the decisions connected to internal energy security policy being mainly in national hands. There are even EU prime ministers who argue against centralized initiatives, simplifying the question as 'the plan (of the EU) is for those who run out of gas to take it away from those who have it'.",

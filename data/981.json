    "output": "After examining certain historical absolute factor exposures of U.S. value funds, we found that the reduction in tracking error for value funds was indeed smaller compared to growth funds. This suggests that value managers may have been taking additional bets beyond value that resulted in weaker alignment with the value benchmark. Therefore, it is important for investors to carefully analyze the investment strategy and factor exposures of value funds before making investment decisions.",

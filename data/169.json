    "output": "Based on the data provided, it appears that there is significant underreporting of land ownership in India, with official statistics and the data collected likely to be inaccurate. Despite this, at least 84% of households report owning at least one acre of land, with some households owning up to 30-50 acres. However, these figures are still much lower than those of the big landlords of the past. It is also noted that land is no longer the sole source of power, with local elites holding on to their land. Only 10% of elite households reported selling land in the past 10 years, with the primary purpose of such sales being to purchase other land or for temporary household needs. Despite this, land remains a primary form of asset for these households, along with other forms of investment.",

    "output": "Concentration of foreign primary energy supply refers to the degree of dependence of a country on a single or a few foreign sources for its energy needs. The Herfindahl-Hirschman index is a commonly used measure of concentration, which calculates the sum of the squares of the market shares held by individual firms in an industry. In the context of foreign primary energy supply, the index is calculated based on either the number of foreign suppliers or the number of foreign suppliers and fuels. However, the indicator does not take into account the reliability of imports, which can be a significant factor in determining the vulnerability of a country's energy supply. Additionally, the indicator does not account for the fungibility of energy sources, which refers to the ability of a country to substitute one source of energy for another in the event of a supply disruption. Finally, the indicator ignores transportation risks and the flexibility of different modes of transport, which can also affect the security of energy supply.",

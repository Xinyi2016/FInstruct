    "output": "After analyzing the exhibit, it is evident that controlling non-target factors in a growth strategy significantly helped capture growth's long-term premium. Beta (volatility), earnings yield (value), and momentum accounted for roughly a combined 300-basis-point (bp) difference between the annual performance over the two periods. In the simple growth strategy, the growth factor had a similar contribution to return in both periods in the analysis, but exposure to non-target factors had very different levels of impact. Therefore, controlling the non-target factors helped to minimize the negative impact and increased the chances of capturing growth's long-term premium.",

    "output": "One example of a product substitution strategy that Spanish exporters could have used to maintain their relationship with large US retailers is to substitute olive oil produced in Spain with olive oil originated in non-tariff countries. This strategy would allow Spanish exporters to offer a price-competitive product while maintaining the quality and reputation of their product. This strategy was feasible for Spanish exporters whose competitive strategy in the US was based on prices. The main goal of these exporters was to maintain their relationship with large US retailers. These retailers would not have accepted a rise in prices, forcing the Spanish exporters to find alternatives to offer a price-competitive product.",

    "output": "Microcredit and digital loans are two different types of financial services that cater to individuals with limited access to traditional banking services. Microcredit typically provides larger loans, but the application and repayment process is more involved, which may make it less suitable for immediate needs. On the other hand, digital loans are more convenient and accessible, with a shorter application process and quicker disbursement of funds. However, the design of digital loans may contribute to stress, as the repayment schedule can be more frequent and the interest rates can be high. Despite these differences, both microcredit and digital loans can have a positive impact on individuals' well-being, with evidence suggesting that access to microcredit can reduce symptoms of depression and digital loans can improve subjective well-being by providing a sense of security and anticipation of future borrowing.",

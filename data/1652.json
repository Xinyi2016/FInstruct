    "output": "Based on our analysis of a universe of global stocks over the past 24 years, we found that the performance of some systematic equity strategy (SES) factors decayed faster than others. The factors that showed greater decay rates depended on rapid implementation to provide significant positive information ratios. These factors include short-term reversal, industry momentum, news sentiment, and analyst sentiment. On the other hand, the stable SES factors like investment quality and momentum had relatively stable exposures and could be implemented following a substantial delay with only minor effects on resulting information ratios. However, it's important to note that there are exceptions, like the yield factors which showed substantial decay over the first week. Overall, this analysis can provide valuable insights for institutional investors who frequently rebalance their portfolios and want to deepen their understanding of the factors that fuel performance.",

    "output": "Figure 5 shows the incidence of renewable energy consumption between countries and sectors. The data reveals that there are several countries leading the transition towards new energy sources, with notable patterns in the development of renewable energy usage in different macro-areas. The Nordic European region, including Sweden, Norway, and Finland, has a high incidence of renewable energy consumption, with Sweden and Norway relying heavily on hydropower and bioenergy. South America is also a leading producer of renewable energy, with Paraguay and Uruguay having high incidences of renewable energy consumption. Africa has vast potential in renewable energy resources, with Mozambique, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, and Zambia being among the greenest African countries. The data also shows that sectors with a higher incidence of renewable energy consumption tend to transition more easily to renewable sources, with the Wood and Paper sector being an exception.",

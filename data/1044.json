    "output": "Thank you for your request to report on our company's workforce diversity. While we appreciate the value of granular information, we acknowledge the limitations of voluntary, unstandardized reporting. In our report, we have used the categories under the EEO-1 report to disclose workforce breakdowns by race or ethnicity and have not combined categories to create different demographic groups. We have also reported race and ethnicity breakdowns separately from gender breakdowns. We understand the importance of standardized reporting to enable investors to make comparisons, and we will continue to work towards improving our reporting to provide meaningful and valuable data. As of now, we have not reported any hiring or workforce diversity targets or implemented career development plans targeted at underrepresented groups. We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplace and will continue to seek ways to implement change.",

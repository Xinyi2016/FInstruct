    "output": "While the low vacancy rates in the industrial sector may lead to strong market rental-value growth, investors should exercise caution as there are also potential risks associated with this trend. One factor to consider is the elastic supply of the industrial sector, which may limit income growth compared to other property types. Although new industrial properties are easier to bring online than offices in central business districts, this may also lead to oversupply in the market and ultimately decrease rent prices. Therefore, investors should carefully evaluate the fundamentals of the industrial market and assess whether it aligns with their long-term growth expectations before making any investment decisions.",

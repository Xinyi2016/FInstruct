    "output": "The study found that risk premium is not affected by MNA and is consistent with time-series evidence, showing that response to MNA decreases at longer maturities. The concentration of the response to MNA in short-term and medium-term yields implies that this news contains little information about a risk premium. Similarly, the lack of spread in the cross-section suggests that changes in key macroeconomic variables do not have a significant effect on risk premium. These results are consistent with asset pricing models, in which risk premium is not strongly correlated with the business cycle. However, the study also notes that the short sample period makes it impossible to separately estimate the price of MNA factor risk in separate subsamples with high precision, so further research is needed to confirm these findings.",

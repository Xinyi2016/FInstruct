    "instruction": "Please explain the two reasons behind suppressed equity volatility.",
    "output": "The first reason behind suppressed equity volatility is the technology sector's outperformance, which offset negative returns from other sectors such as financials, energy, and health care. The second reason is related to the high gamma exposure of short-dated options. Market makers, who are often long gamma, remain delta-neutral by selling (buying) futures when the market rises (falls), thereby dampening realized volatility. On the other hand, if market makers are short gamma, they would consider buying (selling) futures when the market rises (falls), amplifying realized volatility. Based on April 2023 expirations for U.S. options, market makers would need to buy (sell) USD 16.5 billion for each 1% down (up) move in the index, assuming investors are short calls (i.e., market makers are long gamma) and long puts (i.e., market makers are short gamma).",

    "output": "As a private-equity investor, it is important to carefully manage liquidity in light of the potential cash crunch stemming from the market sell-off in the first three quarters of 2022. Our analysis shows that capital calls and distributions in 2023 could drop below historical averages, which could reduce our ability to fund upcoming contributions with distributions from prior vintages. To manage these potential funding challenges, we need to analyze the impact of the market sell-off on our fund's cash flows, taking into account the lagged sensitivity of private-equity entries and exits to public-market returns. By developing a liquidity management strategy that considers potential scenarios and informs commitment pacing and funding decisions, we can better prepare ourselves for any potential funding challenges that may arise.",

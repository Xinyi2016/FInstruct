    "output": "During the tariff period, a significant portion of olive oil imported in bulk from Tunisia and Portugal was bottled in Spain and exported to the US as a substitute for tariff-targeted olive oil from Spain. Spanish firms labeled these olive oil containers as originating from Tunisia or Portugal, which was crucial for their tariff-avoidance strategy. US Customs considered the bottling process in Spain to be insufficient to qualify as a major product transformation, so they recorded the shipments from Spain as imports of olive oil from Tunisia or Portugal. Since these countries were not subject to tariffs, Spanish exporters were able to avoid additional import duties. This information is based on media reports and personal communications with industry representatives, including an interview with Rafael Pico, Director of Asoliva, the Spanish Association of Industry and Exporters of Olive Oil.",

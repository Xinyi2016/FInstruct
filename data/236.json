    "output": "The tariff-avoidance strategy of Spanish olive oil exporters involves manipulating the HS 6-digit level classification of their exports to avoid US tariffs. This has led to a large discrepancy between the value of exports reported by Spanish customs and the mirror value of imports reported by US customs. Specifically, since the introduction of tariffs, US imports of olive oil from Spain have decreased by 53% relative to the pre-tariff period, while Spanish exports to the US have increased by 14%. This suggests that Spanish exporters are finding ways to avoid the tariffs, potentially by misclassifying their exports at the HS 6-digit level.",

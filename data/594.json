    "output": "After reviewing the MSCI Economic Exposure Indexes paper, it is recommended that investment managers use the indexes to tilt their portfolios towards domestic stocks with higher international exposure, create a more \"pure\" domestic bias in their portfolio, dynamically allocate to securities in countries or regions displaying momentum, increase or decrease allocations via passive exposures, and diversify globally through a portfolio of companies with diversified regional exposure. These strategies will help investment managers better understand the geographic distribution of company revenues and enhance their investment decision processes for constructing and managing global portfolios.",

    "output": "Energy system interconnection refers to the connection of different energy systems, such as electricity grids, to share resources and balance out peak load hours. In an interconnected system, peak load hours in individual countries can be balanced out by geographical balancing, reducing the overall need for storage discharging power. This is because the non-aligned peak residual load hours of the different countries help to reduce residual storage discharging power needs. Even with limited interconnection, the non-aligned peak residual load hours of the different countries help to reduce residual storage discharging power needs.",

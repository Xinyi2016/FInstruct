    "output": "The difference in Spanish exports and US imports of olive oil and tariff-targeted products is due to the recording criteria used by Spanish Customs. Spanish Customs recorded all containers shipped from Spain to the US as exports, even if they were not filled with olive oil produced in Spain. This led to an increase in Spanish exports of olive oil to the US despite the imposition of an additional 25% tariff. However, this recording criteria did not affect the export revenue of Spanish exporters of tariff-targeted products to the US relative to other Spanish exporters. The gap between Spanish exports and US imports began to narrow once tariffs were lifted in March 2021, but a large gap remained even one year after tariffs had been removed, suggesting that some Spanish exporters continued to export olive oil originated in other countries after the elimination of tariffs.",

    "output": "A Markov diffusion is a stochastic process that models the evolution of a random variable over time. It is characterized by a set of differential equations that describe the probability distribution of the variable at different points in time. In the context of financial markets, the risk-free rate of interest can be modeled as a Markov diffusion, where the probability distribution of interest rates evolves over time according to the differential equations. This model allows for the simulation of different interest rate scenarios and can be used to price financial instruments such as bonds and mortgages.",

    "output": "The study found that elite households have control over and are involved in the disbursal of different kinds of resources, which they classify into three categories: economic (E), political (P) and social (S). The study found that 61% of elite households are active in all three spheres, with 18% providing only economic services. The study also found that control over economic resources still plays a significant role in rural power dynamics, and exercising influence over different interlinked spheres of rural life is important.",

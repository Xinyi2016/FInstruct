    "instruction": "Based on the three hypothetical scenarios presented, please provide a recommendation on how to adjust our investment strategy in the coming months.",
    "output": "Given the uncertainty surrounding the economy and monetary policy, we recommend adopting a cautious approach and closely monitoring macroeconomic indicators. In the event of a soft landing scenario, it may be appropriate to explore equity investments, as they may regain ground. However, in the event of a slam-the-brakes or stagflation scenario, we recommend reducing risk exposures, diversifying portfolios, and potentially increasing allocations to safe-haven assets such as gold or government bonds. It is important to remain flexible and adjust our investment strategy in response to new information and the evolving macroeconomic landscape.",

    "output": "The aim of the model is to support studies in comparing alternative monetary regimes with a simple model of the current monetary system as a baseline. The model structure is built based on pre-defined requirements and fully implemented within the continuous time agent-based modeling language ML3. ML3 allows for easy access, improvement, expansion, and discussion of the model for working with it and assessing its quality. A provenance graph is necessary to identify and relate various sources, mechanisms, submodels, and activities that contributed to generating Mak(h)ro_0. The model can replicate a wide range of stylized economic facts with incisive limitations to reduce model complexity. The replication of stylized facts is necessary to show that the simulated model macro-/microeconomic dynamics are plausible and capture characteristic patterns and distributions of empirical data. Therefore, the ABM Mak(h)ro_0 presents a possible starting point for exploring and analyzing alternative monetary regimes in comparison with the current monetary system.",

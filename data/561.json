    "output": "With the increasing global nature of the real estate asset class and rising currency volatility, it is becoming increasingly important for real estate investors to carefully manage currency risk. Historically, real estate investors have had a strong home bias, but this is gradually being eroded as investors look to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to cross-border real estate investments. However, currency movements can have a big impact on performance, and investors with foreign currency exposures may wish to think carefully about how they manage such exposures. Factors such as what should be hedged and when is the right time to hedge are important considerations. While there are many potential factors to consider and many of the decisions may not be straightforward, it is clear that currency risk management will become a growing source of investment risk as real estate becomes increasingly global in nature.",

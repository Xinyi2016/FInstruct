    "instruction": "Explain the behavior of investment and consumption time series in the model and compare it to empirical observations.",
    "output": "The model shows that investment time series is more volatile than GDP time series, with a relative standard deviation of 4.58 compared to real GDP. Consumption, on the other hand, shows a less volatile behavior with a standard deviation of 0.44. These findings are consistent with empirical observations, which show a relative standard deviation of 0.80 for investment and 8.22 for unemployment. The model also replicates persistent fluctuations in the time series, but no long-term growth due to model assumptions.",

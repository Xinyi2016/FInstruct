    "instruction": "Summarize the findings of the study on the impact of digital credit on borrowing from formal and informal sources.",
    "output": "The study found that increased access to digital credit causes applicants to substitute from informal credit towards formal credit. For applicants below the credit score threshold, the auto-approval treatment increased an index of formal borrowing by 0.88 standard deviations and decreased an index of informal borrowing by 0.33 standard deviations. The substitution away from informal credit is driven by a large reduction in borrowing from friends and family and a small reduction in borrowing from moneylenders, but there is no effect of the treatments on the use of other digital lenders, banks, or cooperatives. The study also found that there is no significant effect of increasing the initial offer on use of informal credit.",

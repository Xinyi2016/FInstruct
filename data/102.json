    "instruction": "Given a limited sample period and size surrounding the event of interest, we opted for an autoregressive volatility model, resembling the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model of Corsi (2009).",
    "output": "The standard HAR model uses daily, weekly, and monthly average volatilities to model future levels of volatility. However, we opt for a different specification that suits our research design more.\n* For example, our sample period covers only around four months of data; thus, monthly and weekly volatility patterns are unlikely to emerge and are consequently not employed.\n* HAR models are mostly employed for studying daily level of volatility, while we model intraday price fluctuations.\n* In such scenario, existing literature suggests that intraday seasonality patterns influence the volatility persistence (e.g., Ederington and Lee 2001; Chang and Taylor 2003; Seemann et\u00a0al. 2011) and we control for their existence.\n* Also volatility is susceptible to extreme observations, that we observed during the actual start of the military conflict in February. Such observations are likely to bias the parameter estimates. Therefore, we control for such abrupt changes in the market conditions by introducing specific day effects.\n* The onset of the crisis is likely to cause a non-linear response in the market behavior, which led us to estimate the model in the log-log form.\n* Finally, because of the high persistence level and limited sample size, we run a battery of unit-root panel tests (see description under Table 1); the results suggest that a unit root is not present in our series. However, during a time period of such extreme uncertainty, implied volatility might appear (in a finite sample) to have a unit-root-like behavior. Thus, to err on the safe side, we also consider a specification using the first differences of implied volatilities.\n* We use seven model specifications, with the most general (Model 7; see Tables 3 and 4) being as follows:",

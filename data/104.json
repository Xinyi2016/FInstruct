    "instruction": "Summarize the key findings of the study on the effects of economic sanctions and conflict on the foreign exchange market.",
    "output": "The study finds that the financial market, the Russian ruble, and the relationship between economic sanctions and the Russian economy are factors that precede larger price fluctuations on the foreign exchange market. Investors' expectations, as measured by implied volatility, encompass information from these attention measures and even beyond. The study also finds that changing investors' expectations are relevant for the euro exchange rate, indicating increased sensitivity to short-term changes in expectations. The geographical position of the Euro zone may be a factor in this increased sensitivity.",

    "output": "As an investor interested in emerging markets, it is important to research the ESG ratings of companies within the Latin American market and compare them to other emerging markets. According to recent data, the proportion of lower-ESG-rated companies ranges from 16% to 78% of individual country indexes, based on market capitalization. In particular, the Mexican market has struggled with ESG risk mitigation in the past, but has begun to narrow the gap with other Latin American markets since 2015, though it has slipped in the past two years. It is important to note that anti-corruption, labor-management, and corporate-governance practices can vary widely from market to market, and investors should be aware of these differences when making investment decisions in emerging markets.",

    "output": "To better understand the true risk underlying a real estate portfolio, it is important to look at data beyond traditional sector and geographic analyses. This can be achieved by analyzing extreme outperformers and underperformers that drive the tails of total return distribution. Factors such as lease and tenant exposures, as well as active management (such as refurbishment), can affect returns even for seemingly identical assets in the same geographic area. Examining performance along alternative risk dimensions, such as vacancy rates, can help institutional investors identify common sources of risk that pervade the entire portfolio. By considering factors beyond market-level data, investors can more accurately assess the risk associated with their exposures and develop effective investment strategies.",

    "instruction": "Please provide a brief overview of the performance of oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas and consumable fuels industry, aerospace and defense, and integrated oil and gas industry factors in the third quarter of this year.",
    "output": "In the third quarter, there was a significant shift in the performance of several industries. The oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas and consumable fuels industry factors, as well as aerospace and defense and integrated oil and gas industry factors all went from high positive values in the first and second quarters to a significant negative in the third quarter. This could be attributed to the second wave of the energy price-run effect that impacted energy-consumption-intensive companies. As a result, the overall impact of industries on the active performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes went from substantial during the first half of the year to insignificant this quarter.",

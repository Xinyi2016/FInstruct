    "output": "The analysis of factor-based investing and its relationship to macroeconomic conditions found that Equal Weighted and Value Weighted factor indexes have been the most cyclical, while Minimum Volatility and Quality have been the most defensive. The MSCI Momentum, Value Weighted, and Equal Weighted Factor Indexes exhibited the highest active returns following a large positive shock to trend growth in Developed Market (DM) economies. In addition, Minimum Volatility, High Dividend Yield, and Quality outperformed following a large negative shock. When growth has remained positive or strengthened, then the Equal Weighted Factor Index has historically outperformed and Minimum Volatility underperformed. On the other hand, in an environment of slowing growth, an investment in Quality has generally outperformed, and when coupled with low inflation then Minimum Volatility has outperformed.",

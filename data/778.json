    "instruction": "Can you please explain the exhibit's display of the GEMTR market factor and the COVID-19 factor, and how they performed over a specific period of time?",
    "output": "Sure, the exhibit displays the performance of the GEMTR market factor and our combined COVID-19 factor from Jan. 1 through April 20. The COVID-19 factor is defined by the weighted combination of its input factor returns, and by construction, the factor performed well and was strongly anti-correlated with the market over this period. This means that the performance of a COVID-19 factor may have been useful in estimating market sentiment toward the pandemic.",

    "instruction": "Summarize the related literature on underpricing and its implications.",
    "output": "Related literature on underpricing suggests that it can be used to infer the importance of agency and informational problems. Benveniste and Spindt (1989) predict positive average underpricing because investors are rewarded for providing value-relevant information. Bradley and Jordan (2002) argue that prices respond to public and private information, which is inconsistent with bookbuilding models. Lowry and Schwert (2004) argue that the IPO price is \"almost efficient\" with respect to public information. However, Beatty and Ritter (1986), Loughran and Ritter (2002), and Loughran and Ritter (2004) argue that underpricing is pure unproductive rent.",

    "instruction": "Can you explain the importance of say-on-climate votes in pressuring companies to adopt credible net-zero strategies?",
    "output": "Say-on-climate votes are a powerful tool that investors can use to put pressure on companies to adopt credible net-zero strategies. These votes allow shareholders to express their opinions on the level of engagement that a company has had on climate change and can be used to hold companies accountable for their actions. If investors feel that a company has not done enough to address climate change, they can push for a say-on-climate vote or vote against a climate-related management resolution to effect change. While it remains to be seen whether these votes will become a mainstay or fade into obscurity, they demonstrate investors' willingness to experiment with innovative engagement tools and use their influence to drive positive change.",

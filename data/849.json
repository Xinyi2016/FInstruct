    "instruction": "Please provide an analysis of the forward P/E levels for MSCI ACWI at the end of Q2 2020.",
    "output": "The forward P/E for MSCI ACWI at the end of Q2 2020 was 19.18, which is a significant increase from the end of Q1 when it was at 13.39. This rise in the forward P/E is a result of the strong recovery in the markets, which has led to an increase in valuations for many benchmark regional indexes. The chart below shows that these valuations have surpassed their historical median levels and are now at their all-time high. However, these levels are not necessarily sustainable, as the recovery has been quick and sharp as compared to the expectations of forward earnings. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution and avoid making investment decisions solely based on high valuations and P/E ratios.",

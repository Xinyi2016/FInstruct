    "instruction": "Please analyze the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the CDS market and explain how difficulties in transferring bonds and making payments due to sanctions could affect the CDS implied default probability.",
    "output": "As per the task instruction, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to distortions in the CDS market. If a default occurs, the underlying bonds would need to be auctioned, but difficulties in transferring these bonds due to sanctions or other market frictions may cause an inflation in the premium required for default protection. This would further raise the CDS implied default probability. Additionally, the sanctions could cause issues in making bond payments, which could trigger a technical default where a firm is unable to pay coupons or principal. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the CDS market when analyzing default probabilities.",

    "instruction": "Please review the impact of the underweight allocation to the oil-related industries in the MSCI ACWI climate change indices in the third quarter and provide insights on the performance of the low carbon indices.",
    "output": "In the third quarter, the underweight allocation to the oil-related industries had a significant impact on the performance of the MSCI ACWI climate change indices, particularly in the MSCI ACWI climate change index and the MSCI ACWI climate Paris Agreement compliant index. As a result of this underweight allocation, both indices underperformed, with the MSCI ACWI climate change index and the MSCI ACWI climate Paris Agreement compliant index lagging behind by 19 and 21 basis points respectively. It is worth noting that the low carbon indices had a smaller impact on the allocation to oil-related industries, which was expected.\n\nFurthermore, the MSCI ACWI climate change index has a higher allocation to the United States, and as a result, the recent strengthening of the dollar has had a positive effect due to currency factors. However, this effect was countered by the overweight allocation to China.\n\nThe MSCI ACWI climate index aims to achieve a lower carbon footprint than the broader MSCI ACWI index. The selection of carbon-efficient companies within each sector has been successful in all four indices and has led to similar results as in the first half of the year.",

    "instruction": "Please explain the results of the adaptive multi-factor model.",
    "output": "According to our model, there is an overweight to momentum and an underweight to yield when compared to an equally weighted factor mix. This indicates that the model is favoring momentum factors stronger than it is favoring yield factors. Overall, this could potentially lead to a portfolio with higher returns but may also come with increased risk. It is important to consider these results when creating an investment strategy that aligns with your specific goals and risk tolerance.",

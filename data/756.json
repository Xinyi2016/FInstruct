    "instruction": "Please analyze diversification among sectors using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae) and provide insights on how diversifying across a subset of sectors can be more opportunistic and tactical.",
    "output": "Diversifying across a subset of sectors using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae) could potentially provide more tactical exposure, as opposed to combining all 11 sectors which can lead to market-like exposure. This approach can help reduce the idiosyncratic effect of individual sectors. For instance, during the current market downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare outperformed, while energy underperformed due to the oil price war. Therefore, diversifying among sectors can help investors weather the storm during a market downturn and potentially outperform the market in the long run.",

    "instruction": "Explain the concept of RJVs and how they differ from standard models.",
    "output": "RJVs, or Research Joint Ventures, are a type of collaboration between two or more firms to invest in research and development projects. Unlike standard models, RJVs allow participating parties to coordinate decisions on investment and which projects to invest in, reducing duplication and freeing up resources for further projects without accessing the capital market. This can potentially increase the range of projects that an RJV can invest in compared to independent firms. However, whether an RJV makes use of this opportunity or just enjoys cost savings from avoided duplication depends on financial constraints and the nature of competition.",

    "output": "Noise traders are market participants who trade without consistently adding information to the market. They may be seeking to diversify their portfolio of securities and are willing to accept a cost for doing so, typically by worsening the price on the purchased security. Noise traders are not necessarily irrational, but may have various consumption needs external to the valuation of the security being traded. Some noise traders may also have information relevant to market prices, but this information is primarily about the joint measure of the underlying outcome space that connects multiple complete event markets together, rather than on the marginal measures.",

    "output": "The chart reveals that at the start of 2003, corporate revenues generated by emerging markets accounted for less than 10% of global revenues. However, as these markets developed and switched from low-end manufacturing to higher value-added economic activities and domestic consumption, their revenues soared by 400% to more than 40% by the time the report was published. This significant increase highlights the immense potential that these markets hold for corporations seeking to expand globally.",

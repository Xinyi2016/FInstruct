    "instruction": "Please analyze the performance attribution for growth funds and provide insights on their exposure to health and healthcare themes.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis of the performance attribution, we found that growth funds were significantly underexposed to health and healthcare themes. In comparison to the top-quartile funds with exposure to next-gen internet, millennials, fintech, disruptive technology, digital economy or autonomous technology, growth funds had a lower percentage of funds that had above-average H1 2020 returns. This suggests that growth funds may have missed out on potential returns from investing in health and healthcare themes during the first half of 2020.",

    "output": "A study proposed a methodology to extract information on the relevance of each input feature as a predictor of the future export of each of the 5000 possible target products at 6 digits. The study constructs a predictive model for the possible future export of each target product, based on the training of a RF algorithm. It then applies a procedure to statistically validate the Gini Importance of the single input features; in this way, it is able to identify the explainers, the key products needed by a country to competitively export a target product in the near future.\nThe study finds that using the 97 2-digit aggregated sectors as features reduces the predictive power of the RF with respect to using the 6-digit 5040 products. However, an optimization of the machinery in order to perform the analysis also for 4- and 6-digits features is currently under study, and will be the subject of future works.\nThe results of the study confirm the validity of the proposed approach, as the Feature Importance Product Space (FIPS) represents a forecasting model on countries\u2019 future exports which retains (and even overcomes) the predictive power of the black-box algorithm it is based on, while allowing for a clear interpretability of its predictions, typical of the low performing network-based approaches. The FIPS correctly captures information about the complexity of products, by inserting the most sophisticated sectors into dense clusters and isolating the less complex products. These findings pave the path to characterize the capabilities needed to be competitive in the export of complex products.",

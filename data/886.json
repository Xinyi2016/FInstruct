    "instruction": "Explain the concept of yield compression and how it affects property prices in prime locations in global cities.",
    "output": "Yield compression refers to the decrease in yield or income generated by a property investment. In prime locations of global cities like Manhattan, Paris\u2019s eighth arrondissement, and London\u2019s West End, demand for property is high but the supply is limited, resulting in higher prices and lower yields. As the demand for property in these areas increases, investors are willing to accept lower yields, which makes these areas more expensive on a relative basis. This is a common phenomenon in prime real estate markets, where investors are willing to pay a premium for the security and prestige associated with owning property in these locations.",

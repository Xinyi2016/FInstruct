    "output": "To determine if diversifying a portfolio by investing in a larger number of equities will be beneficial for risk reduction, we can use a quantitative measure that considers the relationship between unsystematic risk and systematic risk. Specifically, we can argue that diversification is beneficial if the unsystematic risk is sufficiently large compared to the systematic risk of the collective market.\n\nTo quantify this relationship, we can use the leading eigenvalue of the cross-correlation matrix as a proxy for the collective behavior of the market or a subset of the market. A larger value of the leading eigenvalue indicates stronger collective behavior, which suggests that diversification may not lead to a significant reduction in overall risk.\n\nAdditionally, we can use modularity, a diagnostic borrowed from complex network analysis, to probe into how far sectors function as mutually independent sets of equities. This can provide further insight into the degree of collective behavior in the market and the potential effectiveness of diversification in reducing risk.\n\nOverall, by considering both the collective behavior of the market and the independence of individual sectors, we can develop a quantitative measure that informs investors about the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolio.",

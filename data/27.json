    "instruction": "Propose a computational framework for computing global solutions of nonlinear, high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic models.",
    "output": "The proposed computational framework consists of the following components:\n1. An adaptive high-dimensional model representation scheme that significantly reduces the number of grid points in the approximation and the time needed for each function evaluation.\n2. An adaptive sparse grid algorithm applicable for recursively formulated economic models.\n3. Adaptivity criteria which can be used as an on-the-fly analysis tool elucidating the complexity of the model under consideration.\n4. A vectorized implementation for performant interpolation.\n5. A hybrid parallelized time iteration solution framework fit for virtually any dynamic stochastic economic model.\nThe framework is designed to efficiently address the bottlenecks of ever-increasing complexity in state-of-the-art dynamic stochastic economic models. It has been deployed at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) to solve highly nonlinear dynamic stochastic economic models of up to 300300300300 dimensions globally.",

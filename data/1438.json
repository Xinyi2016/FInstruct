    "instruction": "Build a multi-asset-class portfolio with short- and medium-term carbon-footprint reduction targets using a building-block approach and MSCI Climate Indexes as proxies for climate portfolios.",
    "output": "To build a multi-asset-class portfolio with carbon-footprint reduction targets, start by selecting investments from the MSCI Climate Indexes and gradually shifting capital from market to climate portfolios. This approach can lead to a 71% reduction in the total portfolio's carbon footprint over time, with a tracking error of 95 basis points. Additionally, consider reallocating capital towards companies that have ambitious emissions-reduction targets and a strong track record of achieving them. Remember to keep the portfolio broad and diversified while minimizing risk against a standard market benchmark. Lastly, ensure that the portfolio aligns with the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance's short- and medium-term emissions reduction targets to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C.",

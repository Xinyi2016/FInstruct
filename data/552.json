    "output": "Our analysis shows that factor investing strategies can indeed be effective in the China A shares market. However, the unique characteristics of the market, such as higher volatility and shorter cycles, as well as the dominance of domestic retail investors, have led to a different factor return profile compared to global and emerging markets. The illiquidity premium was stronger, analyst sentiment factor performed better, growth had stronger risk-adjusted returns, and there was a stronger small-cap premium in A shares compared to global and emerging markets. On the other hand, value performance was generally less strong compared to emerging markets, and the performance of quality-related factors was less strong compared to EM and DM. It is important to have a model calibrated specifically to the China A shares market in order to capture these unique patterns of factor behavior.",

    "output": "Based on recent research, it has been found that ESG indices did not have a significant impact on the valuation of oil and gas stocks. This is partly due to the sector-inclusive approach used in the design of the indices which minimizes sector-specific biases towards performance. In 2021, individual stock returns were the biggest contributor to performance improvement, followed by style factors that included ESG factors. However, given the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment, it is hard to predict which asset characteristics will contribute the most to a company's resilience.",

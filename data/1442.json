    "instruction": "Provide a summary of how the hypothetical portfolios performed in meeting their climate targets for Investor A and Investor B.",
    "output": "According to the simulated pathways, both Investor A and Investor B's portfolios have achieved their climate targets. By 2030, Investor A achieved a 52% reduction in the carbon footprint, while Investor B achieved a 71% reduction, achieving the more ambitious climate target. The green-revenue targets set by MSCI climate indexes were also met by both portfolios, given the assumption that green revenues at the index level remained static. This was achieved by Investor B through a combination of selecting a faster-decarbonizing climate index and shifting capital more aggressively from broad-market to climate portfolios.",

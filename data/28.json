    "instruction": "Tell me about significant advancements in the development of algorithms and numerical tools to compute global solutions for high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic models over the past two decades.",
    "output": "The computational economics community has pursued two main strands of research: i) SG-based solution algorithms and ii) grid-free methods. SG methods are a mathematically well-studied way to tackle the numerical difficulties that arise in dynamic economic models due to the high-dimensional state spaces, but they typically fail in real applications if the dimensionality of a highly nonlinear model exceeds about 20202020. In contrast, DDSG can handle problem sizes of at least 300300300300 continuous state variables. Grid-free approaches have been proposed, but they typically cannot deal with frictions such as irreversible investments and related nonlinearities. Other research in computational economics has recently applied deep neural networks to compute global solutions to high-dimensional dynamic stochastic models, but these methods still suffer from several drawbacks that limit their general applicability. Nesting the DD approach with the time iteration algorithm is not restricted to SGs, thus providing a simple means to extend the boundaries for research.",

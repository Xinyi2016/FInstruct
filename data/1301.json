    "output": "Based on the MSCI FaCS criteria, we have identified a list of companies with strong quality exposure for investment. These companies display a combination of profitability, low leverage, stable earnings, quality of earnings and limited balance-sheet expansion, which aligns with the findings of our study that firms with higher exposure to the quality factor outperformed across markets and styles. We recommend that portfolio managers, risk managers, and institutional investors consider increasing their exposure to these companies to enhance their portfolio's resilience and potential for long-term growth.",

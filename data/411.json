    "output": "The SPAC process offers four research design advantages in overcoming the challenge of separating the two frictions. First, it divides the process of going public into two distinct phases with potentially different frictions. This allows for a clearer separation of the two frictions and a more accurate measurement of their effects. Second, during the business combination phase, SPACs publicly report the exact allocations to each institutional investor, including the private investments in public equities (PIPE) investors. This reporting is more transparent than that of a traditional IPO, where allocations are not reported, and allows for a more accurate measurement of favoritism. Third, we can measure the investment return history for every sponsor-PIPE pair and create in-sample measures of PIPE \"quality\" and past \"relationship\" based on their track records. This allows for a more accurate measurement of the effects of favoritism on investment returns. Finally, we can use the exogenous shock of the lockup expiration as a \"natural experiment\" to identify the causal effect of the two frictions on investment returns. This allows for a more accurate measurement of the effects of favoritism on investment returns.",

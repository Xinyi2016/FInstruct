    "output": "Research joint ventures (RJVs) are collaborations between two or more companies to conduct research and development (R&D) activities. The main justification for RJVs is the existence of knowledge spillovers, which allow the participating firms to benefit from each other's research efforts. However, our paper proposes a different channel through which RJVs can lead to more innovation: when R&D costs are high and there is significant uncertainty about the right way to generate the desired innovative outcome, an RJV can help reduce investments in duplicate R&D projects, thereby freeing up funds that can be invested in previously unexplored approaches. To achieve this, the firms in an RJV can benefit from reallocating scarce resources across different R&D projects. This feature of our model allows us to investigate how the members of an RJV can benefit from reallocating scarce resources across projects, separating the decisions on how much to invest from the decision in which projects to invest in.",

    "output": "After researching various investment institutions, I found that many are incorporating intuitive, transparent, and comparable metrics into their strategies for limiting global warming. These metrics help track progress and inform decision-making when it comes to investing in companies with environmentally sustainable practices. With regulators and standard-setting bodies such as the TCFD exploring portfolio temperature as a way to measure the position of investors on climate change, we may see a shift towards performance reporting in degrees rather than just returns. Overall, it seems like investment institutions are increasingly recognizing the importance of limiting global warming and are taking steps to do their part in creating a more sustainable future.",

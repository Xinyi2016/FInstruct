    "output": "Yes, I can analyze the performance trends of the two hypothetical portfolios over the last five years. Based on our research, we found that prior to the crisis, both the Europe Global Portfolio and the Europe Local Portfolio performed similarly. However, after the crisis, the Europe Global Portfolio steadily pulled away from the Europe Local Portfolio in terms of performance. This indicates that globalized firms in Europe might be more resilient and less sensitive to the European economy than local firms.",

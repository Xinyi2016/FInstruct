    "instruction": "Please provide insights on whether recent regulatory changes in China represent a structural shift in the risk premium and growth rate of Chinese stocks.",
    "output": "As per the common prediction of sell-side research analysts, the fundamentals of the Chinese stock market seem to be stable. For instance, as of July 2021, the consensus forecast for long-term earnings growth per share of components of the MSCI China All Shares Index had risen from 11.6% five years ago to 22.2%. This is significantly higher compared to the estimates of the MSCI Emerging Markets and MSCI Developed Markets indices. Therefore, the regulatory changes may not necessarily symbolize a structural shift in the risk premium and growth rate of Chinese stocks.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze how decarbonization targets may conflict with improving liquidity in developed-market corporate-bond indexes.",
    "output": "Our analysis indicates that improving liquidity by choosing bonds with higher amounts of debt outstanding can actually improve the emission footprint of hypothetical indexes on average. However, choosing issuers with higher total bond liabilities could also improve the hypothetical index\u2019s carbon footprint, but would increase concentration. This raises the question of whether decarbonization targets may be at odds with other desirable index attributes such as liquidity. If less liquid bonds are excluded from the selected index, it could potentially harm the index\u2019s emission profile. Overall, there is a need to balance important investment goals such as improving liquidity and achieving decarbonization targets in corporate-bond index construction and management.",

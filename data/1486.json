    "output": "According to historical sensitivities, contributions and distributions to private-equity buyout funds are expected to be lower in 2023 than their historical levels from 2016 to 2020. This is due to the slowdown in private-equity capital calls and distributions, which could continue into 2023 as a result of the public market sharply selling off earlier in the year. Additionally, the diminishing availability of viable buyout deals due to high borrowing costs could cause contributions to drop by as much as 35% in the scenario of stagnant long-run growth. Furthermore, diminished valuations may cause managers of private funds to delay selling portfolio companies or force them to exit at lower prices, driving distribution reductions in 2023. Scenario distributions from vintage 2014 and 2015 could drop by 20% to 50%.",

    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of the Leaders approach relative to the Growth index over the past half-decade. Explain the factors that have contributed to Leaders' outperformance.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that the Leaders approach has outperformed the Growth index over the past five years, primarily due to its overweight in high-scoring, thematic firms. These differences in approach help to explain why Leaders has been more resilient than the Growth index during periods of market decline. Specifically, our research indicates that the majority of Leaders' longer-term outperformance can be attributed to its focus on companies that align with specific themes, such as technological innovation, sustainability, and healthcare. By selecting firms that fall within these themes, the Leaders approach has been able to capitalize on market trends and generate strong returns for investors.",

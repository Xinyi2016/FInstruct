    "instruction": "Summarize the theory of research joint ventures and the main differences between our paper and the existing literature.",
    "output": "Our paper differs from the existing theoretical literature on RJVs in two important dimensions. First, the literature does not allow for different R&D projects. Second, it does not address financial constraints. Instead, it focuses mainly on spillovers. The literature has also highlighted important caveats to the claim that research cooperation is socially beneficial, such as product market collusion leading to dynamic inefficiency.",

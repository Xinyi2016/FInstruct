    "output": "Paying attention to beta when markets are volatile can be valuable in understanding the movements of the market. As high-beta stocks sold off rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2018, many of the losses from that period reversed at the start of 2019. Factors, including beta, also reverted to the mean in the subsequent quarter. By examining quintile plots from a global perspective, it becomes apparent that there was a rotation in developed markets, but a modest rotation in emerging markets. Additionally, cyclicals outperformed defensives by over 3% from the start of January through March 1, with the largest driver of this outperformance being beta itself. Therefore, tracking the beta factor can assist investors in bringing focus in fast-moving markets.",

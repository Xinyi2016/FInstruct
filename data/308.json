    "output": "Financial expectations play a crucial role in shaping the real economy. They are influenced by both exogenous and endogenous factors. Exogenous factors refer to external events such as changes in the global economic outlook, new information, and adverse shocks that can quickly modify long-term expectations. Endogenous factors, on the other hand, refer to the reactions of expectations within the system to changes in capital levels. The combination of high sensitivity to exogenous conditions and strong reactivity to variations in capital can lead to large fluctuations of capital in the system. This can create or inflate expectations, attracting capital, but also potentially leading to undue capital outflows. In such cases, the only remaining tool to reduce capital outflows may be dividend policy, which can come at the expense of the labor force, capital expenditures, and future growth.",

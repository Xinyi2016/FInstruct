    "instruction": "Please provide an explanation of how the growth of regional-focused active strategies impacted the aggregate assets and growth rates of active EM and Asia funds between 2004 and 2019.",
    "output": "During the 15-year period from 2004 to 2019, the growth of regional-focused active strategies played a significant role in impacting the aggregate assets and growth rates of active EM and Asia funds. The aggregate assets of these funds grew at a 10.4% annualized rate, compared to the aggregate size of active EM and Asia single-market-focused funds, which grew at a rate of 7.7% annually. This growth was supported by the ability of active managers to generate higher alpha in EM compared to the developed markets over the same period. Additionally, the buildup of an EM derivatives ecosystem extended the scope and flexibility of regional-based strategies, further contributing to the growth of these funds. Overall, the growth of regional-focused active strategies had a significant impact on the performance and growth of active EM and Asia funds during this period.",

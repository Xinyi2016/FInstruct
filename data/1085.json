It is important to note that according to our stress tests, the simulated investment portfolio may incur a loss of approximately 2%, with global stocks experiencing a slightly lower loss of around 5% and government bonds potentially seeing a 2% increase. The healthcare industry has shown resilience during this time, while other sectors such as airlines, shipping, consumer services, media, and retail have seen significant declines.

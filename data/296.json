    "output": "Central Bank credits play a crucial role in the unsecured interbank market by providing sufficient liquidity to dampen interbank rate fluctuations and prevent interbank market imbalances. The Central Bank acts as a Lender of Last Resort and ensures that banks have access to sufficient liquidity to meet their financial obligations. This helps to maintain stability in the financial system and prevent systemic risks from spreading. Central Bank credits can be used by banks to meet their short-term funding needs and to manage their liquidity risk. The Central Bank also uses open market operations, such as buying and selling securities, to manage the money supply and influence interest rates. By providing Central Bank credits and conducting open market operations, the Central Bank can help to maintain price stability and promote economic growth.",

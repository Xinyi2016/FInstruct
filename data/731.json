    "output": "Institutional investors often utilize derivatives contracts like futures and options as a risk management tool to hedge against market uncertainties or to express their performance/risk preferences. These contracts allow investors to lock in a future price for a particular asset or index, which can help protect against market fluctuations. For example, during recent crises, some investors turned to futures contracts based on the MSCI EM and MSCI China Indexes as a way to manage exposure to those markets while maintaining liquidity. Additionally, the ability to trade futures contracts on a multicurrency basis allows investors to more effectively manage currency risk and diversify their portfolios. Overall, derivatives contracts are an essential tool for institutional investors looking to manage market risks and optimize their investment strategies.",

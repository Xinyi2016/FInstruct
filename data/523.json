    "output": "The case study of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. highlights the importance of connecting the dots across markets in order to understand issuer-level turbulence. The convulsions of Hertz\u2019s equity price throughout the summer of 2020 suggest that some equity investors were unaware of bondholders\u2019 recovery expectations. The equity rally in early June took place while holders of Hertz bonds and credit-default swaps were expecting losses as high as 90% during default. However, the equity rally was then followed by an upswing in recovery expectations. Since Hertz debtholders would be entitled to any funds the company were to raise in an equity sale, the rally in market-implied recoveries may have been a reaction to the equity appreciation, a possibility only visible by evaluating the issuer\u2019s entire capital structure. This strange state of affairs nearly led to an unprecedented public-equity offering by a company in the throes of bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe case study of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. demonstrates that investors need to consider the entire capital structure of an issuer in order to fully understand the issuer\u2019s financial situation and make informed investment decisions. By connecting the dots across markets, investors can gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issuer\u2019s financial health and potential risks, which can help them make better investment decisions and avoid unexpected losses.",

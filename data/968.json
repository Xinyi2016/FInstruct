    "output": "Our research shows that equity markets have not consistently reacted immediately or as expected to climate-related political or regulatory events. This may be due to the protracted nature of political decision-making processes and the fact that markets often price in policy changes prior to their final adoption. However, over longer periods, we found that more carbon-efficient companies' outperformance developed slowly over time and accelerated in the past two years. The transition towards a net-zero economy is a complex process sprinkled with events that allow us to gauge how much climate transition risk is transmitted to firms' stock prices. Our hypothetical transition channel explains how changes in climate policies such as the 2015 Paris Agreement may be reflected in stock prices, with more carbon-efficient firms having a comparative cost advantage. Overall, the timeframe used in evaluating the impact of events on market prices is critical to understanding how climate risks have been reflected in equity prices.",

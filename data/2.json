    "instruction": "Can you provide insights on how different sub-industries within the financial sector were impacted by negative news on SVB and Credit Suisse, and how this affected news-sentiment scores before and after the height of the crisis?",
    "output": "According to a study using MSCI Factor Lab's news-sentiment score, the negative news on SVB and Credit Suisse had a swift impact on the aggregate news-sentiment scores of banks in the financial sector. U.S. banks were hit worse than their European counterparts, resulting in a sharper decline in the news-sentiment score of U.S. banks. When comparing news-sentiment scores for various sub-industries within the financials sector before and after the height of the crisis, it was observed that the decline in the relative news-sentiment score of regional banks was greater than that of diversified banks. This could be attributed to clients preferring to move deposits from smaller regional banks to larger banks during uncertain times. Additionally, negative sentiment was widespread across financial institutions in the U.S., with the news-sentiment score of U.S. asset management and custody banks also experiencing a significant decline.",

    "output": "Our MSCI Biodiversity-Sensitive Areas Screening Metrics assess industries exposed to deforestation risks by identifying companies that have physical assets located in WWF Deforestation Fronts. As of Nov. 30, 2022, we found that 140 of the constituents of the MSCI ACWI Index had a potential direct contribution to deforestation. Of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae) sectors, high-risk industries potentially contributing to forest loss included metals and mining, oil, gas and consumable fuels, transportation infrastructure and food products. We also found that a total of 244 constituents (8.7%) may indirectly contribute to forest degradation by using commodities such as palm oil or soy in their business.",

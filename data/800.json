    "output": "In analyzing risk in the COVID-19 environment, we utilize historical data from previous crises such as the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) and the oil crash of 2014. We consider various combinations of those periods as a reference to manage risk against hypothetical scenarios. By looking at historical crises, we can build risk forecasts and help investors analyze risks during more recent events such as the COVID-19 downturn. Overall, deploying a risk framework is an active, dynamic, and multifaceted effort that requires careful analysis of historical data to manage risks effectively.",

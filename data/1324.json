    "output": "Investors are currently facing large uncertainty in how inflation and monetary policy may evolve. There have been swings in expectations, and it is yet to be seen how the Russia-Ukraine war will affect growth and inflation. Additionally, growth forecasts for 2022 are being adjusted downward and U.S. GDP growth is estimated to be as low as 1.5% for the first quarter. Long-term inflation expectations have also risen, and there could be room for even stronger inflationary pressures. Overall, there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions.",

    "output": "The MSCI ACWI Index had a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2020, with a 14.8% increase and an all-time high reached on Dec. 31. This was driven by hopeful news of effective COVID-19 vaccines, Joe Biden winning the U.S. presidential election, and the U.K. exiting the European Union. Despite economic uncertainty, equity markets remained resilient during this period. In terms of factor rotation, momentum pulled back while book-to-price gained gains. High-beta stocks were favored over low-beta stocks by investors.",

    "output": "The study examined the persistence of price-sensitive traders across markets and found that the distribution of the number of markets in which a trader was price-sensitive is highly skewed. Only 25% of traders were price-sensitive in more markets than the mean, while 75% were price-sensitive in fewer markets than the mean. The study also found that traders who appear as price-sensitive in a number of markets are not price-sensitive in every market in which they participate. For example, the maximal trader, who was price-sensitive in 64 markets, was also price-insensitive in 42 other markets. This suggests that evidence of price-sensitivity in a market does not necessarily provide much information about the likelihood of price-sensitivity in a future market. The study also found that only one trader was price-sensitive with 100% frequency, but this trader only participated in one market. These results have important implications for market participants and policymakers. They suggest that traders may not be able to rely on past price-sensitivity to predict future price-sensitivity, and that policymakers should be cautious when using evidence of price-sensitivity in one market to inform policies in other markets.",

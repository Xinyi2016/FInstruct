    "output": "The MSCI FaCS characteristics of the FAANG stocks as of July 27, 2018, show that while they are commonly grouped as tech stocks or growth companies, their characteristics are far from homogeneous. Factor exposures revealed significant variability among the FAANG stocks, with Apple being the only FAANG with a positive exposure to value, and Netflix having a very large exposure to growth. It is also important to note that factor exposures have varied not only across seemingly similar stocks, but have also been quite dynamic and changed over time for individual companies. For example, Apple had negative exposures to all four factor groups in the early 2000s as it sought to redefine itself, but after the success of their new products in the mid-2000s, almost everything surged, including growth, profitability, stock price, and valuation ratios. In the last few years, growth has slowed, valuations have come down significantly, operating performance has strengthened, and they have been more conservative in the use of capital. This highlights the importance of analyzing securities and portfolios beyond questions of sector or value versus growth and understanding unique factor fingerprints to improve the understanding of critical drivers of portfolio risk and return.",

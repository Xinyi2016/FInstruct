    "instruction": "Based on the analysis of various factor weighting strategies, recommend a suitable approach for multi-factor allocations in factor investing for institutional investors.",
    "output": "Our analysis found that a Simple Diversification strategy that equally weighted six factor indexes has historically proven more effective than many of the more complex approaches, especially after accounting for index turnover cost. This approach may appear na\u00efve in construction but offers simplicity, transparency and robustness and can serve as an attractive starting point for factor allocation. However, if investors have active investment views and skills, they may benefit from exploiting fundamental insights in the construction of a multi-factor index. In such cases, the decision on the appropriate strategy to adopt depends on the investors\u2019 investment beliefs and process and whether they have the insight or skills to manage factor exposures dynamically. The relative merit of each strategy can be measured by the information ratio versus turnover - a key element of cost.",

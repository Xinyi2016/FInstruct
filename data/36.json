    "output": "The evolution of global stock markets over time has been studied using insights generated from evolutionary correlation structures. These structures have been analyzed using a variety of statistical and mathematical techniques to uncover various insights related to the evolution of global stock markets over time. The study of time-evolutionary correlation structures has also been of great use in other fields, including equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, and cryptocurrencies. However, one must note that given the nonstationary and volatile nature of financial securities, they often exhibit heavy-tailed distributions, which can lead to limitations in the naive application of the Pearson correlation metric.",

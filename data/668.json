    "instruction": "Can you explain what is meant by \"concentration risk\" in equity portfolios?",
    "output": "Concentration risk refers to the risk that can arise from holding a highly concentrated portfolio, where a few stocks or a single sector account for a significant portion of the portfolio. This can be seen in the case of FAANG and BAT stocks, where these groups of stocks make up a large portion of their respective indices. Not being aware of concentration risk can result in reduced returns and potentially negative impacts on a portfolio's performance. Therefore, it's essential to diversify investments and have a clear understanding of the potential risks involved.",

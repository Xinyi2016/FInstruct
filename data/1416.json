    "output": "PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) has proposed a financed-emissions disclosure standard based on accounting rules for financial institutions worldwide. The standard will be in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which is a global standard for emission footprints. Financial institutions will be required to account for their financed emissions from the annual emissions of the company or project they finance, proportional to their share of investments in the company or project. PCAF recommends the disclosure of financed emissions across all sectors and separate disclosure of Scope 3 emissions for selected sectors.",

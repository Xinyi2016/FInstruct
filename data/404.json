    "output": "Variable renewable energy sources, such as wind power and solar photovoltaics (PV), are expected to play a significant role in meeting the increasing demand for electricity as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. These sources of energy are variable due to their dependence on weather conditions and daily and seasonal cycles. However, their potential is vast, and with the right infrastructure in place, they can provide a significant portion of the world's electricity needs. The integration of spatial and temporal flexibility options, such as transmission of electricity between different regions and countries, and different types of electricity storage, can help to manage the variability of wind and solar power and ensure a stable and reliable electricity supply.",

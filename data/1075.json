    "output": "Based on the data, it can be concluded that a majority of auto loans have an original balance between USD 10,000 and USD 40,000. High-balance loan groups performed worse in prime tiers, but better in subprime tiers. This is due to the fact that a higher-balance loan statistically has higher LTV and lower gross coupon, which tend to have offsetting credit effects. For prime tiers, gross-coupon differences were minor for loans above USD 20,000, and default events increased monotonically with LTV as well as balances.\n\nOn the other hand, for subprime tiers, LTV stabilized for loan sizes above USD 30,000, so the performance improved as balances increased and gross coupons dropped. Interestingly, there was a small group of deep-subprime loans with low coupons, short terms, and high balances that outperformed their cohort peers in all observable dimensions. This suggests that credit scores have not presented the full story and other factors may be at play. Overall, understanding the impact of loan balance on credit performance is important for lenders and consumers alike.",

    "output": "The exhibit below highlights the importance of assessing a company's risk management practices according to TNFD's LEAP methodology. For industries located in biodiversity-sensitive areas, the risk management practices of utility companies were found to be relatively robust. These companies had policies and programs in place to reduce adverse impacts on nature. On the other hand, the metals and mining industry had a relatively high share of assets in sensitive areas and weak management practices. This leaves them more exposed to future regulations and stakeholder pressure.",

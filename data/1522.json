    "output": "In today's rapidly changing corporate landscape, it is essential to have a diverse and innovative board of directors. To address the aging board members and lack of diversity, we can implement several strategies. First, we can actively seek out qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds, including women and individuals from emerging markets. Next, we can establish term limits for board members to ensure a regular turnover of directors and fresh perspectives. We can also create a mentorship program that pairs experienced board members with younger, diverse candidates to cultivate leadership skills and promote diversity. Finally, we can encourage ongoing education and training for board members to keep them up to date on new skills and emerging trends. By implementing these strategies, we can ensure a board that is diverse, innovative, and well-equipped to guide our company into the future.",

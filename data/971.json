    "instruction": "Please analyze the financial market reactions to major events in the past five years and determine the extent to which they were influenced by event-related transmission channels.",
    "output": "After analyzing the data, we found that the regression coefficients for the one-day period were not statistically significant nor consistent for most events. Therefore, we need to temper our results and recognize that some policy changes, such as the Paris Agreement, may not have been true \"surprises\" and were already priced in by financial markets. However, even surprising events, such as Donald Trump's election as president of the U.S. in 2016, had a noticeable impact on prices for more carbon-efficient companies, which went against expectations. While results for other variables were in the expected direction, they were not statistically significant. Based on these findings, we can conclude that the existence of strong event-related transmission channels is not well-supported by the data.",

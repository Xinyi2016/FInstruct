    "output": "In Figure 8, we see the normalized compute time for one step of the time iteration for a 20202020 and 50505050-dimensional IRBC model. The left panel shows results for a 20202020-dimensional model with a fixed maximum refinement level of 10101010 and varying maximum expansion orders of 1111 and 2222. Here, we have 20202020 and 210210210210 component functions for the respective maximum expansion orders. The right panel shows results for a 50505050-dimensional model with a fixed maximum expansion order of 2222 and varying maximum refinement levels of 4444 and 5555. In contrast to previous test cases, we have 1,27512751,2751 , 275 component functions for both tests, which is larger than the maximum number of nodes. The results show almost ideal strong scaling up to a number of nodes equal to the number of component functions for both tests. After this point, additional parallelism is taken from the secondary, less efficient layer of parallelism in the SG algorithm. Furthermore, we see that the difference in the SG maximum refinement level slightly affects the parallel performance, with higher maximum refinement levels providing a marginal advantage in scalability.",

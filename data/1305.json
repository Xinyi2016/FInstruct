    "instruction": "Can you give me some information on the performance of China's green bond market index compared to other fixed income market indices?",
    "output": "In recent years, the performance of China's green bond market index has been better than the overall fixed income market and most sub-market indices. For example, the ChinaBond China Green Bond Index had a return rate of 5.74% in 2021, higher than the overall bond index (ChinaBond New Composite Index, 5.09%) and corporate bond index (ChinaBond Credit Bond Index, 4.30%). Its one-year return rate lagged behind the ChinaBond Treasury Bond Composite Index by 11 basis points, but its three-year and five-year return rates were 62 and 88 basis points higher than the government bond index, respectively.",

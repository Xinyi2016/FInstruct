    "output": "The proof of the existence of the critical frontier and the differentiability of the value function involves several non-trivial and non-standard mathematical steps. First, we define a class of \"simplified\" strategies, called bang-bang strategies, where exploration happens in zero time and cannot occur simultaneously with consumption. We use these bang-bang strategies to define the value function and prove rigorously that this value function satisfies an HJB equation, which is different from the one found in the literature, but is more amenable to mathematical analysis.\n\nNext, we prove the existence of the critical frontier by showing that the frontier is increasing in explored area. This is done by using the HJB equation and the properties of the value function to establish that the critical frontier is well-defined and has the desired properties.\n\nFinally, we establish that the value function is differentiable across the frontier by using the smoothness of the value function and the properties of the HJB equation. This allows us to prove that our HJB equation is equivalent to the one found in the literature, and prove that our bang-bang strategies are optimal within a general class of strategies for this problem.",

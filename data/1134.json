    "output": "After analyzing the transaction costs for the XYZ ETF, it appears that the cost to buy or sell shares is relatively low. However, when looking at the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, there is a noticeable gap. This suggests a potential risk for price-NAV deviation, especially in less liquid market conditions. As an investor in this ETF, considering transaction costs may be a useful tool in managing this source of risk.",

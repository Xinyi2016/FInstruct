    "output": "It is disappointing to see that consumers still prefer higher-emission pickups and SUVs despite the increasing awareness of the environmental impact of these vehicles. The continued increase in product emissions is concerning and needs to be addressed by car companies. California\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle mandate and regulations in the EU and Asia are steps in the right direction to push companies to prioritize lower-emission vehicles. I believe that it is important for consumers to also make an effort to choose more eco-friendly options and for governments to provide incentives for the purchase of these vehicles. Ultimately, it is up to all of us to make a collective effort to reduce our carbon footprint and protect the planet.",

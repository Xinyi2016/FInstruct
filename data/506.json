    "output": "Recent advancements in DID design have shown that treatment timing can affect the accuracy of DID estimates. The study uses a two-step estimation strategy with a bootstrap procedure, proposed by Callaway and Sant\u2019Anna (2021), to address this issue. The CS-DID estimator compares treated households to those who have never been treated and those who have not yet been treated, and uses inverse probability weighting or doubly-robust methods to re-weight the control group and ensure that the observed characteristics of all treated cohorts and the control group are balanced. The CS-DID estimate is 0.013, which is very close to the main result of the study.",

    "output": "The paper provides a complete and rigorous solution of the Arrow and Chang model using the mathematical theory of impulse control. The main findings of the model are that impulse strategies are optimal within a general class of rules that may include both continuous and jump-type exploration, possibly with simultaneous consumption. This has important implications for the realized price of reserves and extraction profile. The model also confirms another conjecture of Arrow and Chang, that there is a critical frontier separating exploration and consumption regions, which is increasing in the amount of explored area. The paper also derives the implications of the model for the behavior of the histories of prices, exploration, and reserves, showing that while the expected price always rises continuously at the rate of interest, a realized price trajectory may in general jump up or down upon exploration, with a final upward jump upon resource exhaustion.",

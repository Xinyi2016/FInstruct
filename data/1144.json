    "output": "In the inflation scenario where the funding ratio experienced a significant drop, special contributions played a vital role in the eventual recovery. The injection of additional funding helped to stabilize the fund and prevented it from falling further. Without the special contributions, the funding ratio could have continued to decline, potentially resulting in further financial strain for our DB pension fund. The effect of the special contributions was significant, as it allowed us to accelerate our recovery by several years, which was crucial for the long-term health of the fund.",

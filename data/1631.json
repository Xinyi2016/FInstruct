    "output": "The increase in weight of sovereign green bonds between 2018 to 2023 likely contributed to an increase in the index's sensitivity to interest-rate movements. This means that the impact of interest-rate movements on the index became more pronounced due to the greater presence of green bonds in the index. As a result, government-issued green bonds were one of the major contributors to the index's positive returns in USD from 2017 until late 2021, a period of relatively low and stable global interest rates. This is significant as it demonstrates the potential for significant positive returns to be achieved through investment in government-issued green bonds during periods of low and stable interest rates.",

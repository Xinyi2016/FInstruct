    "output": "According to the chart provided, both climate indexes have been historically underweight in energy and overweight in information technology. Additionally, the indexes have deviated from the MSCI ACWI Index by being underweight in value stocks. These allocations have helped the climate indexes achieve their net-zero-aligned climate objectives by having a lower carbon footprint and higher green-revenue exposure as compared to the MSCI ACWI Index.",

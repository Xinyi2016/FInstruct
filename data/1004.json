    "output": "According to the exhibit, from March 2020 to February 2021, value, yield and size ETFs saw the biggest inflows since November last year, with a total of USD 27 billion flowing into these factor ETFs in the four months through February 2021. This trend seems to have emerged most recently as investors respond to changing market conditions, including increasing numbers of COVID-19 vaccinations driving global economies further toward reopening and recovery, and equities worldwide being up slightly in Q1 2021, as reflected by the MSCI ACWI Index's overall increase of 4.7% for the quarter.",

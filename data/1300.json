    "instruction": "Please analyze the exhibit above and provide your interpretation of the likelihood of a firm's transitioning from one quality cohort to another a decade later.",
    "output": "Based on the exhibit, it appears that firms with a higher quality rating are more likely to remain in that category ten years later. The data shows that 75% of firms that began as high-quality remained in that category, while only a third of lower-quality firms were able to move up to a higher quality rating. This suggests that factors such as economic moats and strong balance sheets may play a significant role in a firm's ability to maintain or improve its quality rating over time.",

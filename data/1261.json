    "instruction": "Please analyze the impact of used-car prices on the performance of subprime auto loans using the MSCI Auto Loan ABS Collateral Model.",
    "output": "According to the MSCI Auto Loan ABS Collateral Model, used-car prices have historically had a significant impact on the performance of subprime auto loans. As shown in the exhibit provided, a strong secondary-market vehicle price has promoted prepayments, while suppressing defaults and severity. Since April 2021, used-car prices have jumped and remained elevated, which has closely followed subprime auto loans' prepayment speed while their defaults and severity have fallen further. However, the net percentage of domestic banks tightening standards for auto loans turned negative in 2021, which indicates a loosening credit environment that may negatively affect the quality of auto loans. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the current performance can continue, which will depend on when the supply-demand imbalance can be relieved and the auto market heads toward normal.",

    "instruction": "Write a brief summary of the impact of \"Abenomics\" on Japanese firms and global investors.",
    "output": "During Shinzo Abe's tenure as prime minister from late 2012 through late 2020, Japanese equities partially rebounded from their post-1980's-bubble decline, with expanding corporate profit margins accounting for the bulk of market return. From a corporate-governance perspective, there have been clear improvements to Japanese firms' board practices and gender diversity over the past decade. However, Japanese firms still trail other developed markets in key measures of corporate performance and governance. Abe's aggressive economic policies were geared toward restarting Japan's stagnant GDP growth and slowing deflationary pressures, and while his legacy had some positive impacts on shareholders and global investors, the full extent of their implications remain to be seen.",

    "output": "Weather is random and its impact is properly identified from an economic perspective. However, the impact of a weather shock is not the same as the impact of climate change. Weather studies estimate the short-run response of the economy, whereas the interest is in the long-run response, with adjustments in capital, behavior, and technology. The conditions under which weather variability is informative about climate change are restrictive and not met in many cases. Therefore, extrapolating the impact of weather shocks does not lead to credible estimates of the impact of climate change.",

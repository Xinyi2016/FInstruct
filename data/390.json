    "instruction": "Can you summarize the findings of recent experiments on the information aggregation hypothesis and their implications for market pricing?",
    "output": "Recent experiments have shown that the information aggregation hypothesis, which suggests that market prices reflect the aggregate information of all participants, may not be generalizable to more complex market environments. The experiments indicate that better pricing depends on having more informed traders in the market. These findings do not contradict those of Plott and Sunder, who originally proposed the information aggregation hypothesis, but rather highlight the limitations of the hypothesis. The experiments suggest that in complex market environments, the presence of informed traders is necessary for accurate market pricing.",

    "output": "Private infrastructure investments have become increasingly popular among institutional investors due to their perceived low beta and inflation hedging qualities. However, there are potential risks and uncertainties associated with these investments that should be taken into account. Firstly, private infrastructure assets are heterogenous in their risk and return profiles, and may have higher volatility and correlations than currently modelled. Secondly, there may be reporting bias in private infrastructure investments which could mask underlying risks. Finally, recent market events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the potential vulnerability of certain infrastructure assets, such as transportation infrastructure, which could lead to lower returns than expected. Investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before adding private infrastructure to their investment portfolios.",

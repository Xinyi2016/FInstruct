    "output": "The zero lower bound (ZLB) refers to the point at which the Fed Funds rate, the main tool of monetary policy, is at zero and the Fed has limited ability to conduct monetary policy by changing the policy rate. At ZLB, the Fed has a very limited ability to stimulate the economy by slashing the Fed Funds rate, and it has a very low monetary uncertainty since the Fed Funds rate is unlikely to move significantly in either direction. While theoretically possible, a negative Fed Funds rate is very unlikely due to implementation difficulties. Furthermore, at ZLB an increase in the Fed Funds rate at any given point in time is less likely as well. From the standpoint of the baseline New Keynesian model, a zero Fed Funds rate means that the Fed is likely to have a negative desired Fed Funds rate. Thus positive growth news of a small magnitude is likely to lead to the Fed updating its desired Fed Funds rate to a less negative number and leaving the actual Fed Funds rate at zero. Thus a low interest rate implies low monetary uncertainty.",

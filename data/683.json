    "instruction": "Using the MSCI FaCSTM factor classification standard, analyze and compare the factor exposures of two international value funds to determine how consistent they are with their fund name strategies.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis using the MSCI FaCSTM factor classification standard, we found that the first international value fund had a higher factor exposure to value and size, which is consistent with their fund name strategy. On the other hand, the second international value fund had a higher factor exposure to momentum, which suggests that their investment approach may not align as closely with their fund name strategy. Investors may use this information to better understand the factor exposures of each fund and make more informed investment decisions.",

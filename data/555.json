    "output": "Diversifying assets internationally offers a way for Japanese investors to access a broad array of return sources and reduce their home bias, which has come with a huge opportunity cost since the end of 1987. Many institutional investors in Japan have already reduced their home bias equity allocation, but it remains significant, with Japanese public pension plans holding about 50% compared to the country's 8% market capitalization weight in the global equity market. Retail investors typically do not face such limitations and can benefit from diversifying exposure to different countries, currencies, style and industry factors through global investments. Comparing the sources of return for the MSCI ACWI ex Japan Index against the MSCI Japan Index shows that diversification has been beneficial historically. Although there have been significant reforms in the Japanese market since the 1990s collapse, there are still sizable gaps in fundamentals as measured by companies' ability to generate cash flows and reward shareholders. Given this and the fact that nearly 40% of current MSCI Japan Index constituents were also in the index in 1988, relying solely on domestic stocks may not be the wisest way forward.",

    "output": "After a thorough review of the four coronavirus scenarios for financial markets, I recommend that we prepare for the possibility of a more prolonged economic downturn by diversifying our investments and hedging against potential losses. While there is a possibility for a V-shaped recovery, uncertainties around vaccine distribution and the potential for new COVID-19 variants require us to be cautious and incorporate risk management strategies. Overall, I believe that we should maintain a balanced portfolio and monitor the situation closely in order to adapt to any changes in the market.",

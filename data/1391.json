    "output": "The trend in demand for international real estate among the largest institutional investors has remained strong over the last decade, despite the share of cross-border transactions remaining relatively stable between 19% and 26% of total quarterly transaction volumes. However, there is evidence of global alignment in the asset class based on return behavior. Total-return dispersion across national markets in the MSCI Global Annual Property Index has declined since 2008. Meanwhile, the spread of returns across property types has increased due to technology changes and the pandemic, causing headwinds for sectors like retail and office but boosting others like industrial. This trend suggests that allocation decisions based on property type rather than country may offer greater opportunities for outperformance since 2019.",

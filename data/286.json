    "output": "Adding financial derivatives into a portfolio for market completion is important because it allows investors to improve portfolio performance by hedging the risk of new state variables. This was demonstrated in Liu and Pan (2003), where the authors showed that investors can achieve significant improvement in portfolio performance compared to incomplete market investment by adding as many linearly independent equity options as new state variables in the portfolio composition. The work was extended in many directions, including the construction of optimal portfolios with the addition of options to hedge new state variables accounting for stochastic correlation (Escobar et al., 2017) and the solution of derivative-based strategies under an asset\u2013liability management (ALM) framework with the mean\u2013variance criterion (Li et al., 2018). The superiority of the complete market portfolio was also demonstrated in Cheng and Escobar-Anel (2021) in the optimal complete and incomplete strategies for the 4/2 SV model.",

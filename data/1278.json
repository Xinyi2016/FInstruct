    "output": "Blending management strategies with indexed investing can be a beneficial approach for investors looking to transition to sustainable investing and strive toward net-zero commitments. By investing in climate funds to seek a target exposure, investors can utilize futures linked to indexes, such as the MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Indexes, to bridge the gap between climate considerations and market exposure. The historical risk-return profile of the MSCI World Index, active climate funds, and the MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Index shows that a combination of active and index-linked approaches can lead to outperformance of the MSCI World Index. However, active climate funds carry higher risk, whereas the MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Index has a risk profile in line with the MSCI World Index. Therefore, investors should carefully consider both the benefits and risks of blending management strategies with indexed investing before making investment decisions.",

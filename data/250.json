    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed explanation of the process used to monitor ETH(W) transfers from wallets that borrowed ETH from Compound.",
    "output": "To monitor ETH(W) transfers from wallets that borrowed ETH from Compound, we first identify the wallets that borrowed ETH from Compound by searching for transfers from Compound to the wallets. We then search for transfers from these wallets to deposit addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, FTX, etc. We identify deposit addresses by searching for transfers from the wallets to addresses that are known to be deposit addresses of exchanges. We also search for transfers from the wallets to addresses that are known to be main addresses of exchanges, as exchanges typically forward funds from deposit addresses to their main addresses. We only filter for direct transfers to exchanges and thus might miss some additional transfers where the borrowing address first transferred the funds to another address they control. We also note that some of the biggest borrowers ahead of the merge were smart contracts, and it is unlikely that the borrowed funds are transferred directly from these smart contracts to exchanges. However, by only filtering for direct transfers to exchanges, we are able to confidently say that the funds were indeed transferred to exchanges by the borrowers and avoid over-counting, providing us with a lower bound for the total amount transferred to exchanges.",

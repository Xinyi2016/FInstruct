    "output": "The rise of e-commerce has undoubtedly had an impact on the retail industry, leading to the closure of many physical stores and shopping malls. However, the data suggests that the fears of a \"retail apocalypse\" may be overstated. Despite the continued growth of online shopping, retail real estate investment performance has been resilient, providing stable returns. In fact, there has been only a modest difference in the total returns of retail versus non-retail assets. The key to success in the changing retail environment is to understand the relative performance trends across different retail sub-segments and the drivers behind them. Mall managers are adapting to this change by modifying their tenant mix and implementing technological advancements to improve asset management. Furthermore, it is important for retailers to adopt omni-channel strategies to adapt their online and offline strategies and use retail space as a way to build brand awareness and engagement. Overall, the impact of e-commerce may continue to rationalize the over-retailed U.S. landscape, with only the most productive retail real estate surviving, but good quality retail real estate will continue to attract consumers and cutting-edge retailers.",

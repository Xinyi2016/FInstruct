    "instruction": "Summarize the results of the study and compare the performance of the DRL strategy to the benchmark strategies.",
    "output": "The study results show that the DRL strategy outperforms the benchmark strategies in terms of the vast majority of the considered metrics. The DRL strategy has a higher mean PnL value and a more favorable Sharpe ratio compared to the SYM and LIN strategies. The percentiles of the PnL distribution indicate its dominant performance as well. The DRL strategy also has a lower kurtosis value for its PnL distribution, indicating thinner tails, which is a desirable property for risk management purposes. The study also found that the Jarque-Bera test results indicate inconsistency with the null hypothesis (normality of the PnL distribution) for all of the strategies. The terminal inventory distribution for all of the strategies is centered around zero, demonstrating telltale signs of MM behavior (position oscillating around zero inventory). The DRL strategy performance results, when juxtaposed with the SYM and LIN strategy, show a considerably higher mean PnL value as well as a more favorable Sharpe ratio. The percentiles of the PnL distribution (also interpreted as VaR) indicate its dominant performance as well. The DRL strategy has a lower MAP (owing to the effect of inventory penalization), implying that the strategy succeeds at MM without exposing the trader to high inventory risks. The terminal inventory distributions corresponding to the DRL and the LIN strategy seem quite similar, indicating comparable risk preferences. On the contrary, notice the size of the absolute mean terminal inventory distribution corresponding to the SYM strategy, clearly indicating its naive disregard for the inventory risk.",

    "output": "The construction of the free-float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted index took longer when including stocks with low liquidity relative to their size because it required more research and analysis to determine their appropriate weight within the index. In Japan, liquidity and tradability issues were more pronounced than in the U.S., which further added to the time it took to complete the index construction. This is because there were fewer participants in the market for these types of stocks, which made it more challenging to find buyers and sellers at the desired price levels. Consequently, it was necessary to carefully consider how these stocks would affect the overall performance of the index and ensure that they were appropriately represented.",

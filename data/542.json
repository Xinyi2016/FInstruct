    "output": "In the European Union (EU), there are extensive biodiversity-related reporting requirements being developed as part of the EU's 2030 biodiversity strategy. The framework proposes to establish a common classification of economic activities that contribute to protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystems, and to take steps to ensure the financial system contributes to reducing biodiversity risk. In France, Article 29 of the Energy-Climate Law directs financial firms to publish the main biodiversity-related risks arising from their investments. In the US, climate-related disclosure rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission would direct companies that have set targets related to conservation or the restoration of ecosystems to publish such targets and how they intend to meet them. The EU also leads in terms of ambition and scope when it comes to reducing deforestation, with companies that want to sell into the bloc required to ensure their supply chains do not include certain goods and commodities produced on land anywhere in the world that was deforested after 2020.",

    "output": "Diversifying across factors, sectors, and geographies has historically played an important role in portfolio construction, regardless of whether investors include a tactical approach or invest strategically for the long term. Factor and sector indexes have demonstrated differentiated performance compared to their parent indexes over different parts of the business cycle, which includes the current COVID-19-related market downturn. Additionally, a well-diversified global equity index historically has been less volatile and would have avoided the worst drawdowns compared to some purely domestic markets during bear markets. Although the current market turmoil has caused a widespread slowdown in economic activity and significant depletion of investor wealth, diversifying across factors, sectors, and geographies has been shown to play a role in countering the cyclical nature of individual allocations.",

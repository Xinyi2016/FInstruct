    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of factor performance in the third quarter of 2019.",
    "output": "In the third quarter of 2019, quality and low volatility outperformed in all regions, while yield, value, and size did not perform as well. Momentum was highly overvalued at the beginning of the quarter, leading to one of the largest corrections in its spread's history over the summer. Our adaptive multi-factor model showed a mild overweight to value and a mild underweight to yield, with all other factors being neutral heading into the fourth quarter. The defensive outlook of investors was influenced by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, uncertainty around Brexit, and negative economic data such as the U.S. PMI, contracting retail sales in the U.K., and negative GDP growth in Germany.",

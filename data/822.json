    "instruction": "Please interpret the exhibit and explain the AI model's success in differentiating prepayment behaviors between California and New York pools.",
    "output": "The exhibit indicates that the AI model was able to differentiate prepayment behaviors between California and New York pools, which have different attributes like loan size and credit profile. Additionally, the model was able to account for New York's mortgage-recording tax, which tends to lower prepayment response to refinancing opportunities. Furthermore, the AI model produced more accurate forecasts in comparison to the human model. This suggests that the AI model is more capable of accurately predicting prepayment behaviors in different pools, potentially aiding in better decision-making for investors or lenders.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze whether improving the liquidity of a corporate-bond index could potentially harm its decarbonization targets.",
    "output": "Our study shows that improving liquidity through selecting bonds with higher amounts of debt outstanding actually improved the carbon footprint of hypothetical indexes, on average. However, choosing issuers with higher total bond liabilities may also improve the carbon footprint, but could increase concentration. Therefore, there is a potential tradeoff between liquidity and concentration when considering decarbonization targets in corporate-bond index selection.",

    "output": "The influence of special interest money on elected officials is a major concern for Americans across the political spectrum. According to a Pew Research Center survey, it tops the list of problems with elected officials in Washington. This issue is exacerbated by political polarization, with over 70% of Americans believing that voters in both parties cannot even agree on basic facts. Affective polarization, or animosity towards those with different political beliefs, is also on the rise, with nearly 55% of Republicans saying Democrats are more immoral and 47% of Democrats saying the same about Republicans. Despite these deep divisions, the role of money in politics remains a concern for voters of all political leanings.",

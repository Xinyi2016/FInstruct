    "output": "During the analysis period, the outperformance of green companies compared to fossil fuel companies was mainly driven by the underperformance of fossil fuel companies. However, since September 2018, this excess return seems to have accelerated, and the performance of green companies has also become superior to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index. We observed that it was almost equally driven by stock-specific returns (13%) and industry (e.g. oil) returns (18%), which is contrary to what we have seen in the past five years. Although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, there are multiple factors (such as market prices of renewable energy, government regulations, investor pressures, and consumer and industrial demand) that will play key roles and may support this trend in the long term. Whether we call this trend the outperformance of green companies over fossil fuel companies, \"fossil fuel divestment discount,\" \"oil price effect,\" \"transformation dividend,\" or any other nickname, there may be a global capital shift after the COVID-19 pandemic as countries transition to low-carbon economies. Based on these factors, we believe that the trend of green companies outperforming fossil fuel companies will continue and strengthen in the future.",

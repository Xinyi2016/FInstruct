    "output": "Optimal liquidation refers to the process of selling or liquidating assets in a given time frame in order to minimize costs and maximize profits. In the context of the price impact model, optimal liquidation involves traders optimizing their trading speed to minimize temporary trading costs while lowering their inventory to reduce terminal penalties. The presence of an asset bubble adds an extra layer of complexity to the optimal liquidation process, as traders must also consider the potential growth of the bubble and the risk of it bursting before they can sell their assets.",

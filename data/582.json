    "output": "The potential changes in US mortgage policy and industry trends could significantly impact mortgage-related fees and rate spreads. The primary/secondary (P/S) mortgage-rate spread has compressed to around 80 bps, and we expect this compression to continue with potentially lower g-fees and origination fees. The government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 guarantee fee (g-fee), consisting of non-credit and credit cost, could compress by 10 bps and 18 bps, respectively. Origination fees could revert to the historical 20 bps due to lower origination cost and putback risks, and with an additional 7-bp tax benefit, the origination fee could compress by a total of 17 bps. In total, P/S spreads might compress by roughly 45 bps, although the timing and amplitude of this spread compression remain uncertain. These long-term changes could substantially impact prepayment risk in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and create hedging challenges for holders of MBS. Investors may benefit from considering how changes in the level of mortgage-related fees could influence rates and spreads.",

    "output": "The blog post examines the performance of Global Gateway Cities, including London, New York, and Tokyo, in the real estate market compared to other major cities. The study found that while these cities provided higher capital growth, they also had lower income returns than other major cities. However, when adjusting for country effects, Global Gateway Cities tended to outperform, although with higher volatility.

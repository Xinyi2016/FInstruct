    "output": "In their model, if agents believe that their opponents behave at lower levels than their own cognitive bound, they would behave at one level higher than these opponents; but if they believe that the strategies of their opponents are reaching or exceeding their own cognitive bound, they would act within their own cognitive bound. Thus, although the aforementioned researchers have considered a situation where the opponents have the same or even a higher cognitive level than the agents, they treated it as if the opponents were nevertheless one level below the agents. Thus, according to our review of the literature, no extension of the Level-K model allows either the player to believe she faces the same level as herself or apply such belief structure in the analysis of games. More recently, koriyama2018inclusive introduce a model of inclusive cognitive hierarchy that extends the cognitive hierarchy (CH) model in normal form games. Their model allows the most sophisticated player to consider the possibility that other players are of the same level as themselves. However, their model, unlike ours, requests that the belief of the most sophisticated player be consistent with objective distributions of player types. Our model subsumed their model in the extreme case where the strategy of the NLK na\u00efve player is constructed as in CH and requires consistent belief. They explicitly recognize that such a requirement restricts the applicability of their model to most strategic environments such as beauty contests games, market-entry games, coordination games, and centipede games. They also do not characterize dynamic games and belief updates, which are covered in ours.",

    "output": "To increase the green revenue exposure of the MSCI China Climate Change Index and the MSCI China A Climate Change Index, we recommend increasing the exposure to alternative energy and energy solution providers. Additionally, reducing exposure to fossil fuel power generation companies will decrease the brown revenue exposure of the MSCI China A Climate Change Index. Compared to their parent indices, conventional oil and gas companies contribute the most to the brown revenue exposure of the MSCI China Climate Change Index.",

    "output": "The second invasion of Ukraine by Russia has resulted in various short-term issues. One of the most significant impacts is on key energy infrastructure, including substations, thermal generators, nuclear plants, hydropower dams, and gas pipelines. The violence has caused damage to these infrastructures, leading to power outages and energy shortages in Europe. The conflict has also affected the global energy market, driving up the price of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and making energy unaffordable for some countries, such as Pakistan. The rulers of Russia may have miscalculated the impact of their actions, as the decline in energy exports has hurt the country's economy.",

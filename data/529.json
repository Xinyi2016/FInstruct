    "instruction": "Provide a data source that can help ABS investors gain insights into the performance of the loads.",
    "output": "Four years ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced a regulation that requires issuers to provide loan-level data on various aspects of a borrower's loan, including their credit score, income, employment, and the full performance history of the loan. This data can help ABS (asset-backed securities) investors gain new insights into the performance of the loans. By providing transparency into the underlying assets, investors can better assess the risks associated with the ABS and make more informed investment decisions. The loan-level data allows investors to analyze the performance of individual loans in a pool, identify trends and patterns, and evaluate the credit quality of the underlying assets. This level of transparency can also help improve market efficiency and promote fair pricing for ABS securities.",

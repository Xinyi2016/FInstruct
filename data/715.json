    "output": "Despite the inclusion of large companies and those listed outside their home countries, gaps could still remain in aligning the publicly listed investment universe with a country's economy. For example, the inclusion of Saudi Aramco raised the energy sector's index weighting to 6.5%, but the extraction of crude oil and natural gas contributed to approximately 40% of Saudi Arabia's GDP in 2017. Bridging this gap may require an increase in free float, an easing of investment restrictions, or greater liquidity, but these remedies lie outside the control of index providers and investors. However, a focus toward timely inclusion could help in bridging the gap.",

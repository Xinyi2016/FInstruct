    "output": "In the Net-Zero 2050 scenario, energy companies in the carbon-intensive sectors carry the highest policy risk, with an average loss of around 31% of enterprise value. The utilities and materials industry groups are also affected, with an average decline of 15% and 16% respectively. However, the software and services industry group has the lowest amount of policy risk, losing only 0.27% of enterprise value on average. Additionally, industries such as capital goods, technology hardware and equipment, and semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may be able to fully negate their transition risk and see their enterprise value rise under this scenario if they offer low-carbon alternatives.",

    "instruction": "Explain the significance of avoiding DP techniques in the proposed method.",
    "output": "The proposed method avoids using DP techniques altogether, which is especially relevant in the case of portfolio optimization problems. This is because the objective functional or performance criteria is typically high-dimensional while the optimal investment strategy remains relatively low-dimensional. By avoiding DP techniques, the proposed method forms part of the significant recent interest in developing machine learning techniques to solve multi-period portfolio optimization problems that avoids using DP techniques altogether.",

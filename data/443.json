    "output": "Based on the provided information, we can observe that the broadcasting and receiving centrality rankings of countries vary depending on the energy source considered. For non-renewable sources, countries with high internal consumption and international trades, such as the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and Germany, are prominent. These countries have a significant role in both consumption and demand in the domestic and international markets. On the other hand, for renewable sources, dominant countries in the international trade, such as the United States, China, and Russia, are still present in the top positions, but we also see the emergence of leading countries in the transition towards renewable energy, such as Brazil, Canada, Norway, and Sweden. These countries are characterized by their large production of renewable energy or their progress towards cleaner forms of energy.",

    "output": "The analysis of the multilayer networks built using alternative energy sources revealed two main aspects. Firstly, there is a remarkable distinction between renewable and non-renewable energy networks in 1990, but over time, the networks based on different energies become more similar. Secondly, there is an increase in the average maximum flow over time, with a higher growth for renewable energy sources. These effects are mainly due to the transition towards a wider use of renewable energy sources and a higher density in the network.",

    "output": "The monetary transmission mechanism is the process by which changes in monetary policy by the Central Bank affect economic conditions, particularly the price level. This transmission is influenced by the monetary system via channels such as the interest rate channel and the balance sheet channel. The basic model of the monetary transmission mechanism includes the interest rate channel, which affects firms' investment decisions via funding costs and credit demand, and the balance sheet channel, which affects firms' collateral and ability to borrow. These channels are interdependent and lead to aggregate demand and price changes, thereby affecting the business cycle and credit cycle. The expectation channel and indirect effects via financial portfolio decisions and exchange rate changes are excluded in the basic model.",

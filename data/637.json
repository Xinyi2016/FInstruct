    "instruction": "Please analyze and provide data on the employment gap between blacks and Hispanics compared to their availability in surrounding communities for non-IT workforces.",
    "output": "Based on our research, we found that outside of the IT industry, the employment gap between blacks and Hispanics and their availability in surrounding communities was relatively smaller and, in certain cases, non-existent for the general workforce. However, despite these positive trends, there still exist gaps within managerial positions, although they tend to be smaller compared to those observed in the tech sector.",

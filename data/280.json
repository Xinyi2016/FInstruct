    "output": "The study finds that profit-maximizing responses to congestion can limit pollution production in certain biophysical conditions. However, it also identifies a unique dynamic externality problem in the context of orbits, where profit maximization can lead to runaway pollutant accumulation due to a fold bifurcation. The bifurcation arises from fragment-generating collisions between debris objects, but is modulated by the degree to which debris reduces satellite profitability in the short run. The study also highlights a key difference between resource-use dynamics when the relevant capital stock is provided by nature versus when it is provided by humans. Increases in the discount rate make optimal resource collapse more likely for natural capital, but have the opposite effect for artificial capital. Overall, the study provides insights into decentralized and optimal responses to interacting dynamic externalities, with implications for addressing commons problems in various settings.",

    "output": "In 2023, the rise of short-dated options coincided with significant events in the banking industry, including the fall of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and UBS Group AG's takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG. These events led to the highest level of U.S. interest-rate volatility since the 2008 global financial crisis, reaching around 200%. Despite the banking crisis and increased uncertainty, volatility implied by equity-option prices remained relatively subdued in both the U.S. and emerging markets.",

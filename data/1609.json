    "instruction": "Can you explain why Japan's inflation rate had been mostly positive since 2013, but slowed down in 2020 and is expected to slow down in 2023?",
    "output": "Japan's inflation rate had been mostly positive since Kuroda took office in 2013 due to favorable monetary policy, among other factors. However, in 2020, the pandemic disrupted the economy and led to negative inflation. Inflation accelerated in 2022 due to the rise in import prices, but is expected to slow down in 2023 as factors that pushed up import prices, such as high energy prices and a weaker Japanese yen, are expected to wane.",

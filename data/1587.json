    "instruction": "Please analyze the Scope 2 emissions for the Midwest and South regions and explain why they were higher compared to other regions.",
    "output": "To understand why the Scope 2 emissions for the Midwest and South were higher compared to other regions, we disaggregated the figures into grid emission intensity and electricity use. Our analysis revealed that the relatively high Scope 2 emissions in the Midwest were due to high grid-emission factors, while the higher Scope 2 emissions in the Southern states were due to relatively high use of electricity per square meter.",

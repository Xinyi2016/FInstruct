    "output": "An investor with strong convictions might consider an approach allowing tilts toward or away from specific themes when approaching EM equities. One way to do this would be through active allocation to single-country index-based funds. This approach involves a bottom-up approach wherein the investor has a strong view on individual countries or stocks and seeks an active EM manager to execute their strategy. By selecting specific themes and investing in single-country funds, the investor is able to make targeted bets on countries or regions they believe have strong growth potential. However, it is important to note that this approach is riskier than replicating a market-cap-based index, such as the MSCI ACWI Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and requires a high level of conviction and research. Investors should consider factors such as political stability, economic outlook, and market trends when making their investment decisions.",

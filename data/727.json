    "output": "Increasing uncertainty over future growth can have a significant impact on financial markets. As investors become more risk-averse, they may demand a higher premium for the additional risk they are taking on, which could lead to more aggressive discounting of future earnings and lower valuations for companies. This could, in turn, affect market prices, creating an environment of volatility and uncertainty. Ultimately, the effects of increasing uncertainty on financial markets are complex and far-reaching, and they require careful attention and analysis to fully understand and address.",

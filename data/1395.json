    "output": "The slowing growth in e-commerce activity has had an impact on Amazon's first-quarter earnings release. Amazon cited an excess of capacity built up during the worst parts of the pandemic as one of the reasons for the missed earnings. However, it's important to note that one quarter's missed earnings, or even four quarters of slowing e-commerce growth rates, do not necessarily indicate a sea change in the market. This is because e-commerce sales as a share of total retail sales had been growing sharply from 2013 to 2019, before spiking to a 16.4% share in Q2 2020. With the harshest restrictions of the pandemic lifted in the U.S., some return to previous patterns in consumer behavior should not come as a surprise.",

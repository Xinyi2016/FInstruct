    "instruction": "Identify three scenarios that could potentially impact investment outcomes in terms of climate change.",
    "output": "For the first scenario, we could consider a scenario where global warming is limited to below 2\u00b0C, which would be the best outcome for investment outcomes in terms of climate change. The second scenario could be one where climate change is delayed through midrange actions, which would still have some impact on investment outcomes. And finally, we could consider a scenario where global warming exceeds 4\u00b0C, which would lead to significant uncertainty and potential losses for investments. These three scenarios provide a good range of potential outcomes to stress test investment portfolios against.",

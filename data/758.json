    "output": "Our recommended approach to diversification during market crises is to spread investments across different factors, sectors, and geographic regions. This approach has historically played a significant role in combating the cyclical nature of individual allocations, even during the current crisis. While we cannot predict how long the crisis will last or its future direction, diversification can help manage risk by reducing exposure to any single investment.",

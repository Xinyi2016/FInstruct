Check the maximum price-NAV difference for the ETF you are investing in based on MSCI's RiskMetrics\u00ae LiquidityMetrics\u00ae and historical fund flows estimates.\n2. Compare it with the transaction-cost estimates for the ETF.\n3. If there is a significant difference, be cautious of the ETF's liquidity risk.\n4.

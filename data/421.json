    "output": "The results of the study show that the FIPS model outperforms the original Random Forest model in terms of forecasting power, while providing clear interpretability of its predictions. This is an extremely relevant finding, as it suggests that the FIPS model may be a more effective tool for predicting sales of products in the electronics market. The fact that the FIPS model achieves a lower value of AUC-ROC than the Random Forest model is not necessarily a cause for concern, as the AUC-ROC metric is known to be less reliable due to the strong class imbalance of the dataset. Additionally, the RCA baseline model outperforms both the FIPS and Random Forest models in terms of Best F1 Score, which highlights the importance of using different granularity of inputs when training machine learning models. Overall, the results of the study suggest that the FIPS model may be a promising tool for predicting sales of products in the electronics market, particularly when interpretability of predictions is important.",

    "output": "The paper \"Extending the analysis of embodied energy flow in temporal multilayer networks\" by Cornaro and Rizzini (2022) aims to extend the approach of analyzing embodied energy flow in temporal multilayer networks, considering different types of embodied energy sources as well as the time evolution of the sectors' and countries' interactions. The authors focus on the embodied energy flow on temporal multilayer networks based respectively on renewable and non-renewable sources. They compute the embodied energy flows for each couple of countries and sectors in each time period and for different energy sources. The authors then use a methodological approach based on a temporal multilayer network for analyzing the network reliability and resilience and for identifying critical sectors and economies in the system. The proposed measures are new in this context, since embodied energy flows have been either studied using classical centrality measures based on monoplex networks or focusing only on nodes and layers in a given period in a multilayer framework. The identification of strategic sectors can also represent a useful tool for the policymakers in order to develop policies that consider both the economic relevance and the environmental impact of different industries and to assure that the challenge to decarbonize for sectors, that produce the majority of global greenhouse-gas emissions, can be managed considering also a sustainable economy growth. A detailed numerical case study has been developed based on the data provided by the multi-region input-output tables. The proposed methods have been applied in order to detect central nodes and layers in the network both in the whole period and in each year. Additionally, relevant arcs have been identified in each period. The analysis has been repeated considering three different frameworks based on the use of all energy source, only renewable ones or only non-renewable ones.",

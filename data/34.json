    "output": "Diversifying an equity portfolio by investing within and across equity sectors can help reduce risk during periods of financial stability. However, during times of increased collective behavior, such as financial crises, sector-based portfolio diversification may not be effective in reducing risk. Using the degree of collectivity as a proxy for the benefit of diversification, an extensive sampling of equity portfolios confirmed that 30-40 stocks provide sufficient diversification. Additionally, a \"best value\" equity portfolio for diversification consisting of 36 equities sampled uniformly from 9 sectors, and that it is typically more beneficial to diversify across sectors rather than within. The findings have implications for cost-conscious retail investors seeking broad diversification across equity markets.",

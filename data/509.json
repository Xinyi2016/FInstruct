    "output": "Liquidity constraints refer to the inability of individuals or households to invest in businesses due to a lack of sufficient funds. This constraint can prevent potential entrepreneurs from starting a business, especially if the business requires a large initial capital investment. The concept of liquidity constraints suggests that individuals with limited financial resources may not be able to start a business, even if they have a great business idea. The finding that the receipt of cash windfalls exceeding 30 million NT$ has a larger positive impact on business creation in high-capital industries than in low-capital ones supports the idea that liquidity constraints play a role in business creation.",

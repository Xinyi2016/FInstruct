    "output": "It is important to consider currency risk in real estate investment decisions because currencies can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including central bank decisions, changes in inflation, balance of trade and cross-country capital flows, and investor speculation. Currency movements can have a large impact on real estate investment performance, as evidenced by the MSCI Global Property Fund Index, which saw a cumulative total return in GBP of 137% from 2008 to Q2 2020 compared to only 42% in both JPY and CNY. Despite this, currency risk is often evaluated and priced separately from the underlying real estate risk, which can lead to significant discrepancies in investment performance. By taking currency risk into account, investors can make more informed real estate investment decisions and mitigate potential losses due to currency fluctuations.",

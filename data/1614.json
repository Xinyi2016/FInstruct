    "output": "In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, regulators introduced loss-absorbing bonds as a way to promote financial-system safety. However, since their introduction, there have only been a few cases when write-down or conversion to equity has been triggered, which may have given investors a false sense of security about the risks associated with AT1 bonds. Credit Suisse bondholders recently learned that these risks are very real, highlighting the need for greater caution when investing in this type of instrument.",

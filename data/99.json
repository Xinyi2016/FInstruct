    "output": "Limited attention theory, proposed by Barber and Odean (2008), suggests that all investors are subject to a limited amount of information they can process. Therefore, information that receives the most attention is likely to influence investor behavior the most. The study uses Google Trends data to predict future price variation and extends the current literature by addressing the question of whether limited attention theory manifests for intraday trading as well. The study finds that high-frequency attention is still valuable for predicting fluctuations in intraday prices.",

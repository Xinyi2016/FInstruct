    "instruction": "Please provide an analysis of the performance drivers for the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes during the third quarter.",
    "output": "The third quarter was characterized by financial market volatility, interest rate hikes, geopolitical turmoil, and a strong U.S. dollar. These factors had a negative impact on the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes throughout the quarter. While the indexes had a small negative active U.S. allocation, the recent period of dollar strengthening generated a negative currency contribution. The ESG factor did not generate a positive contribution this quarter, but allocations to carbon-efficient companies within each sector were positive. Unfortunately, the negative contribution driven by stock-specific exclusions significantly contributed to underperformance. Overall, it was a challenging quarter for the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes, as the underlying performance drivers were different than those of the first half of the year.",

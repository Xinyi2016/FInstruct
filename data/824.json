    "instruction": "Based on the results shown in the exhibit, please provide a recommendation on whether wealth investors should consider investing in a 50/50 barbell portfolio approach for sustainable income.",
    "output": "According to the exhibit, the 50/50 barbell portfolio approach has shown to improve yields by an average of 5.4 bps, 8.4 bps, and 9.7 bps per year compared to the high-conviction buy-and-hold portfolios over the one-, two-, and three-year investment horizons. This indicates that the index-based high-dividend-yield model portfolio can complement a high-conviction approach and potentially improve yield outcomes for wealth investors investing for sustainable income. Therefore, it may be worth considering this approach in one's investment strategy.",

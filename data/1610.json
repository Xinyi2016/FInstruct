    "output": "The BOJ's monetary policy is expected to be reviewed by the soon-to-be-appointed new governor, Kazuo Ueda, who is an economics professor and former member of the BOJ policy board. Based on our analysis, there are three potential scenarios: \"gradual policy normalization,\" \"full-scale tightening,\" and \"dovish policy.\" Under the \"gradual policy normalization\" scenario, a global equities and U.S. and Japanese government bonds portfolio could potentially gain 0.3%. However, under the \"full-scale tightening\" and \"dovish policy\" scenarios, the same portfolio could potentially experience losses of 6% or 3%, respectively. It is important for Japanese institutional investors to be aware of these potential scenarios and adjust their investment portfolios accordingly.",

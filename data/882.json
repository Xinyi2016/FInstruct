    "instruction": "Based on the information provided, compare the long-term investment performance of offices in global gateway cities to secondary office markets within the same country.",
    "output": "According to the exhibit provided, offices in global gateway cities have delivered higher capital growth over the 10 years ended June 2020 when compared to secondary office markets within the same country. This has been attributed to both higher yield compression and income growth. However, it's important to note that capital flows and investment returns may not be evenly spread within cities, and yield compression without sustained income growth could result in artificially high asset prices over time.",

    "output": "I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Peter Shepard and Andrea Amato for their invaluable contributions to our blog post. Their expertise and insights were instrumental in developing a model that takes into account the dynamic and uncertain nature of cash-flow growth and discounting. Thanks to their guidance, we were able to incorporate factors such as macroeconomic growth and fluctuating corporate profit ratios to reflect a more realistic cash-flow uncertainty scenario. Additionally, Peter and Andrea's input on modeling the real yield curve and equity risk premium helped us account for the complex discounting dynamics that are often overlooked. Once again, thank you Peter and Andrea for your valuable contributions to our post.",

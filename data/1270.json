    "instruction": "Please explain the potential negative consequences of say-on-climate votes and suggest a way to address these concerns.",
    "output": "Detractors of say-on-climate votes argue that they could lead to greenwashing if investors lack the expertise to scrutinize climate plans effectively. Companies could justify inadequate plans in the future by pointing to shareholder approval. However, regularly holding follow-up say-on-climate votes could help assess a company's decarbonization efforts over time. Unfortunately, most say-on-climate votes have been one-offs, and there has been no commitment to hold follow-up votes. This lack of ongoing focus may fuel concerns that the votes could be a distraction.",

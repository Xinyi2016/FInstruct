    "output": "To construct a heterogeneous firm model subject to quality choice which can sell to foreign markets with different preferences for quality, I will follow the approach outlined in Hallak and Sivadasan [2013]. The model will incorporate domestic firms that are heterogeneous both in their ability to produce using lower amounts of inputs and in their ability to produce high-quality products at low costs. These firms will face search and matching frictions in the market for foreign suppliers which differ in their efficiency to supply inputs at a low cost. Although firms have incentives to match with the most efficient supplier, searching involves the payment of a fixed cost and matching is random. The model's features will produce a framework in which firms' export scope and performance is appreciably heterogeneous but still delivers two sharp predictions. First, the impact of an imported cost shock is increasing in the severity of search and matching frictions in the market for foreign suppliers. Second, the impact of an imported cost shock on exports is increasing in the role of imported inputs in production and in the destination market's preference for quality.",

    "instruction": "Can you provide a summary of the findings regarding the growth composition of MSCI's thematic indexes?",
    "output": "Based on our examination, we found that there is a significant variation in the degree of overlap with 'pure growth' stocks across MSCI's thematic indexes. Certain indexes like the MSCI ACWI IMI Digital Economy Index and MSCI ACWI IMI Fintech Innovation Index are primarily composed of growth-oriented firms classified as a growth stock. Other themes that focus on sustainability and energy-related sectors historically have a much smaller share of growth-oriented firms. This implies that traditional growth investing styles may have overlooked firms that are more aligned with these themes.",

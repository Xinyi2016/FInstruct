    "instruction": "Please provide a brief explanation of how the MSCI ESG Rating score differs from the individual E-, S-, and G-pillar scores.",
    "output": "Our analysis found that the MSCI ESG Rating score is an aggregate score that combines the individual E-, S-, and G-pillar scores. While the individual scores provide insight into a company's performance in specific areas of ESG, the aggregate score provides a comprehensive overview of a company's overall ESG performance and tends to reduce risk more effectively. Additionally, our analysis indicates that both ESG ratings and credit ratings are valuable tools for assessing a company's financial value, as they have distinctive characteristics that complement each other.",

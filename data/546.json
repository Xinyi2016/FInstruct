    "output": "The article discusses the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in 2016, which ended August up 15% for the year, after losing 20% in 2015. The rally has been driven by different factors in different countries, including Brazil, Taiwan, South Africa, and India. The analysis examines the performance of each country through the explanatory variables of countries, currencies, and sectors. The country factor has been the largest driver of return differences in emerging markets, and currency appreciation has also played a role. Style and industry effects can also be substantial, with the oil sensitivity factor being one example. The author concludes that a broad-based emerging markets allocation has been effective in capturing the transformations of emerging economies, but differences in drivers of return offer opportunities for investors.",

    "output": "To improve climate assessments, data users should consider implementing quality-control measures, such as regular screening, communication with issuers, and prioritizing sources. This will help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. However, it's important to note that investor demand for improved climate-related data quality is expected to increase in the future. Companies with transparent reporting can benefit from this trend, while those with weak disclosure might face growing pressure.

    "output": "As an institutional investor, it is important to recognize that the skew towards lower ESG ratings in emerging or newly covered markets is not unusual. While 86% of the newly rated constituents of the MSCI China A International Index fall below BBB, the mid-point for MSCI ESG Ratings, there are indicators that suggest Chinese companies may quickly adapt to the new ESG realities. The evolution of ESG awareness among the corporate community is being promoted from the top, as a state-directed transformation is promoting a shift from a resource-intensive, heavily industrialized economic structure to a services- and technology-focused economy with a lighter environmental footprint. This includes strict mandates and favorable tax structures for innovations towards \u201cgreener\u201d long-term economic growth. Sustainable investors should recognize the point at which Chinese companies shift from focusing on near-term compliance requirements to a longer-term outlook on sustaining global competitiveness. They should also seek greater transparency regarding the key ESG risks that companies face and the strategies they devise to more effectively mitigate those risks in the long-term. While Chinese companies may be currently underutilizing a key communication channel for this transparency, new frameworks for mandatory ESG reporting announced by regulatory bodies indicate that more tools and data could soon become available to better inform investment decisions. However, it is important to note that concerns around transparency of business structure, accounting, and business conduct are likely to remain on investors\u2019 radar in the near term and may weigh on MSCI ESG Ratings. Foreign as well as local investors may play a big part in shaping China\u2019s ESG evolution, and it may take up to 18 months for newly issued MSCI ESG Ratings to stabilize as companies conduct internal assessments of ESG risks and focus areas in response to questions from global investors. Overall, it is important for institutional investors to carefully assess the potential risks and track record of Chinese A shares before making investment decisions, but to also recognize the potential for positive long-term ESG outlook.",

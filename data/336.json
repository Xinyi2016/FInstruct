    "output": "To create a BM graph with labelled balls and draw it bigger for easier reading of the numbers within the balls, follow these steps:\n\n1. First, import the necessary packages and load the data into R.\n2. Next, use the BallMapper package to create the BM graph, making sure to include the \"label\" argument in the bm() function to label each ball.\n3. Once the BM graph is created, use the layout() function to adjust the size of the plot. Set the \"width\" and \"height\" arguments to larger values to make the balls bigger and easier to read.\n4. Finally, use the plot() function to draw the BM graph, making sure to include the \"col\" argument to specify the color of the balls.\n\nExample code:\n```R\nlibrary(BallMapper)\n\n# Load data\ndata <- read.csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Create BM graph with labelled balls\nbm <- bm(data, label = TRUE)\n\n# Adjust layout size\nlayout <- layout(bm, width = 8, height = 6)\n\n# Draw BM graph\nplot(bm, col = \"blue\", layout = layout)\n```\nThis will create a BM graph with labelled balls that is drawn bigger for easier reading of the numbers within the balls. The layout of the balls will be identical, and the user can change the plotting seed to slightly alter the abstraction performed by R in creating the visualization.",

    "output": "In light of the current wave of inflation, it is important to understand how equity-market segments behave across different macroeconomic regimes. Previous research has shown that inflation is driven not only by a sharp rise in oil prices, but also by core components. Whether the current wave of inflation is transitory or not, it is crucial to examine the behavior of equity-market segments during different macroeconomic regimes. By doing so, we can identify how equity markets will be affected and make well-informed investment decisions.",

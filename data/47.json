    "output": "The study found that access to small, on-demand loans has a significant impact on subjective well-being. The researchers found that individuals take out these loans to meet short-term needs, and that the impact is greatest for those who are unemployed or have low credit scores. The study also found that providing small amounts of liquidity on demand can have a large effect on closing the gap in subjective well-being between unemployed and employed individuals, as well as those with low credit scores. These findings are consistent with a growing literature that suggests that being unable to access small but critical resources in times of need can be damaging for mental health. Overall, the study highlights the importance of access to credit and financial resources for individuals' well-being, and suggests that policies aimed at increasing access to credit may have positive impacts on mental health and subjective well-being.",

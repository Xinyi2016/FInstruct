    "output": "The exhibit shows that industrial yields rose from 4.0% in Q2 2022 to 5.6% in Q4 2022, resulting in a -28.8% yield impact over the second half of the year. For upper quartile industrial assets, yields rose from 6.5% in Q2 2022 to 8.0% in Q4 2022, resulting in a -19.5% yield impact. For lower quartile industrial assets, (tighter-priced), yields rose from 3.3% in Q2 2022 to 4.8% in Q4 2022, resulting in a -32.7% yield impact.",

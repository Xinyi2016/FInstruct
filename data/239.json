    "output": "The literature on pricing Asian options is extensive, with many studies using various methods to determine their value. The Black-Scholes model has been used to price Asian options in several studies, including [4, 14, 16]. Other methods that have been used include Bessel processes [14], partial differential equations [19, 25, 26], and the Mellin transform [20]. The PDE approach has been found to be particularly useful as it can be applied to a broad range of models and can be solved numerically [25, 26]. Some studies have also developed closed-form pricing expressions for certain types of Asian options, such as floating Asian options [5] and floating strike put arithmetic Asian options [20].",

    "instruction": "Please explain how the various MSCI ESG indices are designed to contribute to achieving a wide range of ESG and financial goals.",
    "output": "The different MSCI ESG indices are designed to align with the objectives of different investors and contribute towards achieving a diverse range of ESG and financial goals. They employ a sector-inclusive methodology that involves incorporating companies with higher ESG ratings, rather than excluding entire sectors from the indices. This approach helps to mitigate the impact of individual sectors on the index returns. As shown in the figure, the weighted average for the Oil & Gas and fossil fuels sector in the five ESG indices is lower than the parent index as of 2021. Additionally, there is no significant over or underexposure in any sector for the ESG indices when compared to the parent index. The underweight of companies in the oil and gas sector helped offset the losses in these sectors. Through the sector-inclusive methodology, the MSCI ESG indices have been successful in catering to the diverse needs of different investors while contributing towards achieving ESG and financial goals.",

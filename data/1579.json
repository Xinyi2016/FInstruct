    "output": "The rate hikes and implementation of QT by the Federal Reserve in 2022 had a significant impact on the mortgage industry. Mortgage rates increased by 378 basis points, resulting in a near 7% increase in the 30-year mortgage rate. This led to a drop in the aggregate conditional prepayment rate for 30-year mortgages, which fell below 5. Additionally, existing home sales slumped significantly in the second half of the year, coming in around 26% lower than the trailing-20-year average. These effects were quickly felt throughout the markets, with the 10-year Treasury ending the year at 3.88%, 236 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.",

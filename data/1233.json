    "output": "We analyzed the performance of the MSCI World Factor and Sector Indexes from December 1975 to October 2021. The MSCI World Momentum and MSCI World Quality Indexes outperformed during rising-inflation regimes with 34 basis points (bps) and 23 bps of monthly excess returns, respectively. Firms with high profitability and low leverage were typically better positioned to pass on rising costs to the end consumer, which may have contributed to Quality's outperformance. The MSCI World Momentum Index performed well in both rising and falling inflation environments. Defensive sectors such as health care, consumer staples, and energy benefited the most in times of rising inflation, while Information Technology was the only other sector with positive excess returns during rising inflation. IT performed even better in falling-inflation environments. The performance spread across sector indexes was larger than for factor indexes.",

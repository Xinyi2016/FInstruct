    "output": "Corporate-bond supply saw a surge between March and May, however, net issuance in June showed a significant slowdown. This is because corporate spreads and rates stabilized, staying within narrower bands than in previous months. Although there was strong demand for corporate bonds during the period of supply surge, resulting in tighter spreads, the Federal Reserve's direct purchases had very little contribution towards this demand. However, over this period, the Fed communicated its intentions to support the market which could have also played a role in the tightening of spreads.",

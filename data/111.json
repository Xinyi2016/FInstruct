    "output": "Coarse wage-setting is a pricing strategy used by firms to set wages in the presence of uncertainty about the fully-optimal salary. Instead of attempting to gather all the information required to compute worker productivity, firms might rely on a rule-of-thumb or heuristic as an approximation. This approach allows firms to make quick and easy decisions about wages, but may not result in the most accurate or optimal wage for the worker. Coarse wage-setting is a form of pricing that is used to set wages for new hires, and is based on the assumption that the worker's productivity will be similar to that of other workers in the same job or with similar qualifications.",

    "output": "The main difference between the models studied in [11] and [4] is the number of risky assets considered. In [11], the model only considers multiple stocks and a bank account, while in [4], the model considers multiple assets that jointly follow a multidimensional geometric Brownian motion. Additionally, [4] also considers transaction costs, which are not present in [11].",

    "output": "Yes, we can replicate the geospatial analysis and data evaluation process used in your study to evaluate diversity and talent utilization within our company. We will start by mapping the locations of our facilities to urban areas that fall within 20-mile \"commutable zones\" based on our workers' average commuting distances. We will then use a combination of geospatial analysis and U.S. Census Bureau data on race and education to create a picture of the available talent pool for each facility. Finally, we will compare our reported workforce and management diversity numbers against the makeup of the relevant local talent pools. This should help us identify any gaps and potential areas for improvement in our talent utilization practices.",

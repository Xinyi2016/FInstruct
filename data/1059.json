    "output": "The increase in the stock character contribution of the green index from September 2018 to May 2020 can be attributed to various global events. These include the passing of over 70 climate-related regulations and measures by governments, industries, and financial institutions, economic and market events such as the decrease in clean technology prices, international strikes and public protests against climate change, and major energy importers increasing their efforts to ensure greater energy independence and transitioning towards low carbon. Moreover, from December 2013 to May 2020, the green-to-fossil fuel market capitalization index ratio had an annualized growth of 17.8%, with the growth accelerating from around September 2018. The green index's outperformance by 7.9% compared to the MSCI global investable market index from September 2018 to May 2020 also partially contributed to this acceleration.",

    "output": "Cross-currency spreads can offer both risks and opportunities for credit investors. For multicurrency investors, these spreads may add to the price variability to consider, along with an issuer's intrinsic credit-spread variability. However, for USD investors willing to hedge or take on foreign-exchange risk, investing in EUR-denominated debt may bring higher yields than investing in USD debt from the same issuers. On the other hand, there seems to be little cross-currency spread opportunity for EUR investors in the current market. Therefore, it is important for credit investors to closely monitor cross-currency spreads and evaluate their positions carefully to seize any possible opportunities while minimizing potential risks. To learn more about cross-currency spreads, you can refer to the studies by Liao (2020) and Ehlers and Sch\u00f6nbucher (2004).",

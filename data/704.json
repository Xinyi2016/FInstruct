    "instruction": "Please provide an explanation of why futures liquidity is important in the global financial market ecosystem and how a lack of liquidity in EM futures can affect investors.",
    "output": "Futures liquidity plays a crucial role in the financial market ecosystem as it ensures that futures contracts can be easily bought and sold without causing significant price fluctuations. A lack of liquidity in EM futures can be detrimental to investors as it forces them to use a basket of liquid local contracts, which exposes them to a high level of tracking risk from country and currency risk. This can be especially problematic during times of market stress, as investors may struggle to manage their EM exposure effectively. However, the good news is that EM futures' liquidity has recently improved, which may make them a more attractive option for investors seeking to manage their EM exposure.",

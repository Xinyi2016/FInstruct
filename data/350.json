    "instruction": "Describe the methodology used in the paper and explain how it differs from other methods used in the field.",
    "output": "The methodology used in the paper involves replacing missing or incoherent data with a reasonable guess, in this case, the arbitrage bound. This approach is similar to methods used in other fields such as clinical trials, sample surveys, and agricultural experiments. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no related work in the context of volatility calibration. The paper proposes using past implied volatility data to replace missing or incoherent bid data, a method called Last Observation Carried Forward. This method does not fit well with the calibration framework because it relies on past data and does not provide an up-to-date estimation of current implied volatility. The paper's methodology addresses this issue by using a dynamic approach that takes into account the evolution of the market over time.",

Write an email to your team explaining how the inclusion of Saudi Arabian stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index could impact your portfolio and what steps you may need to take to address any potential changes.",
    "output": "Dear team,\n\nI wanted to update you on the recent news regarding the inclusion of Saudi Arabian stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. As you may already know, the inclusion process will occur in two steps starting in June this year.\n\nThe inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the index could have a significant impact on our portfolio. On a pro forma basis, the MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI will represent approximately 2.6% of the MSCI Emerging Markets IMI, which includes small-cap stocks, and will add 69 securities to the latter index. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's distinct sector composition and natural currency hedge have historically provided diversification benefits for EM investors.\n\nWe may need to consider making adjustments to our portfolio to take into account any changes resulting from Saudi Arabia's inclusion. It's important to note that Saudi Arabian equities offer above-average dividend yields, demonstrating a potential for income opportunities. Additionally, the country has a different sector composition compared to other emerging markets, with financials and materials comprising more than 75% of the IMI. This concentration risk could potentially impact standalone Saudi Arabian investors, but for us, it offers diversification opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, we may need to consider any potential currency risks as a result of Saudi Arabia's inclusion. As the Saudi riyal is pegged to the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar investors were previously unaffected by the riyal's fluctuations with other currencies.\n\nI encourage you to review our current holdings and consider any adjustments we may need to make in light of these developments. This is a significant market event, and it's crucial that we stay proactive in managing our portfolio.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",

    "instruction": "Please analyze the data in the exhibit and recommend an allocation strategy for the combined China/USA indexes that balances portfolio risk, EPS growth, carbon intensity, and revenue sources.",
    "output": "Based on the data in the exhibit, we recommend a fixed-weight allocation of 40% to the MSCI China A50 Connect Index and 60% to the MSCI USA 50 Index for the combined China/USA index portfolio. This allocation achieves a minimal ex-ante total risk of 18.9%, while also delivering a strong EPS growth rate of 15.6%. Additionally, the portfolio maintains a relatively low carbon intensity of 166.1tCO2e/USD 1 million of sales. The revenue sources are well-diversified, with 39.3% coming from China, 32.9% from the U.S., and 27.8% from the rest of the world. Overall, this balanced allocation strategy effectively optimizes portfolio risk, earnings growth, and environmental impact while maintaining revenue diversification.",

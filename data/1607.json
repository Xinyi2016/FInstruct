    "instruction": "Analyze the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pandemic lockdowns on global stocks with significant revenue exposure to China.",
    "output": "The exhibit shows that global stocks with higher economic exposure to China tended to underperform the risk-adjusted market return between March and October 2022, when Chinese equities underperformed. This suggests that the geopolitical tensions and pandemic lockdowns had a negative impact on these stocks. However, from November 2022 to January 2023, during the rebound of Chinese stocks, high-economic-exposure stocks tended to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis. This rebound was likely due to the prospects of a stronger post-lockdown Chinese economy. Overall, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pandemic lockdowns had a negative impact on global stocks with significant revenue exposure to China, but the rebound of Chinese equities provided some relief.",

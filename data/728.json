    "output": "Our analysis focuses on using the discounted-cash-flow model to reverse stress test recent U.S. equity-market returns in order to understand how different economic scenarios could have contributed to the decline. We have identified three key factors that are most relevant to this analysis: short-term growth, long-term growth expectations, and risk premium. \n\nFirst, we consider the \"Fear\" scenario, which assumes that the economy will continue to function as normal despite the pandemic. In this scenario, we attribute the full equity shock to panicked investors demanding an almost 4% higher risk premium for the same expected cash flows. Investors who remain calm during this crisis may be able to see a long-term benefit from the higher premium, or benefit from a recovery if risk premiums subside. \n\nNext, we analyze the \"Mild Slowdown\" scenario, which assumes a two-percentage point short-term reduction in growth but no change in the long-term outlook. While a short-term slowdown doesn't significantly impact the fundamentals of equities, the decline in equity prices requires a 3.7% increase in the risk premium, which cannot be justified by mildly lower expected cash flows alone. \n\nWe then consider the \"Lasting Recession\" scenario, which assumes a five-percentage point short-term drop in growth and a half-percentage point decline in the trend growth rate. Even with this level of decrease, the recent decline in equity prices is already accounted for. Investors who expect this scenario would still expect a 2.8% higher risk premium at current valuations. \n\nFinally, we analyze the \"Pure Fundamentals\" scenario, which assumes a decline in equity prices purely based on economic fundamentals without an increase in risk premium. This scenario would be a decadelong depression, which is economically bleak. \n\nOverall, there is still a lot of uncertainty with the pandemic and its economic impact. However, our analysis suggests that the recent price drops in equities are driven by the fundamentals unless there is a major depression. Even in a \"Lasting Recession\" scenario, there is still room for a price recovery if risk premia subside.",

    "output": "In Q2 2020, the MSCI USD IG Corporate Bond Index saw strong returns of 7.1% in excess of the duration-matched Treasury returns. This performance was largely due to the Federal Reserve's commitment to purchase investment-grade corporate bonds and provide liquidity to the market. The option-adjusted spread (OAS) of the index also continued to ease throughout the quarter. In terms of credit style factors, carry experienced the largest turnaround and outperformed the parent index by 7.3% on an excess-returns basis. The value and low size factors also outperformed, while defensive factors characterized by issuers with shorter durations and stronger credit ratings fared less well in the recovery.",

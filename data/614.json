    "output": "As of the beginning of September, U.S. price momentum has suffered a drawdown of 4.7% for the month to date. This underperformance was broadly observed across sectors and was mainly driven by strong positive performance of negative-momentum stocks. Meanwhile, the U.S. earnings yield and value factors have delivered positive performance. These high U.S. price momentum scores imply elevated drawdown risks to U.S. momentum strategies. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor the evolving market conditions to mitigate drawdown risks.",

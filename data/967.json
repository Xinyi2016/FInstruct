    "instruction": "Please analyze the relationship between companies' exposure to climate transition risk and their financial performance over a period of seven years using the MSCI Low Carbon Transition (LCT) Score.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we found that companies with better transition risk profiles, as measured by the LCT Score, outperformed their riskier counterparts over the past seven years. This outperformance was observed even after controlling for well-known equity risk and return factors. Our findings suggest that there may be an erosion risk for companies that do not react immediately to climate policy changes and that monitoring exposure to climate transition risk through the LCT Score can be a useful tool for investors looking to manage their risk.",

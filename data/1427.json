    "instruction": "Can you analyze the contribution of companies with green revenues to the positive specific-return contribution for both the MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index and the MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Index?",
    "output": "Yes, we analyzed the contribution of companies with green revenues to the positive specific-return contribution for both the MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index and the MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Index. If we aggregate the specific-return contribution for all companies with green revenues higher than 5%, we can see a cumulative-return contribution of 64 bps for the MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index and 38 bps for the MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Index. While other factors played a role in the specific-return contribution, greater exposure to green revenues may have contributed to performance.",

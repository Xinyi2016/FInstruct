    "output": "Our analysis has shown that the returns of a composite portfolio are sensitive to both policy direction and external factors. We recommend that investors consider a range of potential scenarios, including our \u201cgradual policy normalization,\u201d \u201cdovish policy,\u201d and \u201cfull-scale tightening\u201d scenarios, when designing their portfolios. Based on our findings, appropriate strategies may include diversification across asset classes, currency hedging to mitigate currency risks, and active management to exploit market inefficiencies. Additionally, we suggest monitoring market conditions and adjusting the portfolio accordingly to ensure it remains aligned with the investor's objectives.",

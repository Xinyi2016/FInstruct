    "output": "Investors can use scenario analysis to test the exposure of their portfolios to different climate-change transition speeds by first identifying the scenarios they want to test against. The scenarios could range from a slow transition to a rapid one, depending on the investor's preferences. Next, they can evaluate the potential impacts that each scenario could have on the industries and companies in which they invest. Finally, investors can assess how the valuation of their portfolio could change under each scenario and make adjustments accordingly. This type of scenario analysis can help investors better understand and manage the risks and opportunities that arise from climate change and ensure that their portfolios are aligned with their sustainability goals.",

    "output": "Spanish exporters to the US were able to counteract the increase in tariffs by using two major strategies. The first strategy was to substitute a product originated in Spain with a product originated in a country not targeted by tariffs. For example, Spanish olive oil exporters increased their imports of olive oil from Tunisia and Portugal, countries not affected by the US tariff, bottled it in Spain, and shipped it to the US with a label declaring that the origin of the product was Tunisia or Portugal. Spanish Customs recorded these shipments as Spanish exports to the US. However, as was the goal of Spanish exporters, US Customs considered that the bottling of the olive oil in Spain had not introduced a substantial change in the product, and thus recorded the shipments from Spain as imports from Tunisia or Portugal, with no tariffs imposed. Due to this recording discrepancy, the value of olive oil imports from Spain recorded by US customs accounted for less than 50% of the mirror export value recorded by Spanish customs. This strategy allowed Spanish exporters to avoid paying tariffs on their products and maintain their competitiveness in the US market.",

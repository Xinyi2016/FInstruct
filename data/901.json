    "output": "The exhibit evaluates the performance and risk of individual sector-relative ESG scores before and after factoring in credit factors. The S-pillar showed the strongest difference in residual returns, while the E pillar showed the highest risk reduction in both excess and residual returns. Additionally, the total MSCI ESG Rating score proved to be more effective in reducing excess and residual risk than the individual pillar scores, indicating that aggregating E, S, and G risks into a combined ESG score adds financial value.",

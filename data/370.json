    "output": "The study uses a discrete choice model to infer the parameters of the smuggler's utility function. The model is based on data on the characteristics of a given incident and the choices made by the smugglers. The study focuses on the question of boat crowding and estimates the value that smugglers place on the revenue collected from adding more passengers, relative to the reduced chance of success when using larger boats. The methodology is limited by the lack of data on events involving the Libyan Coast Guard, which makes it difficult to connect smuggler choices to outcomes at the incident level. This hinders efforts to identify smuggler strategy because it hides the smuggler's reward function.",

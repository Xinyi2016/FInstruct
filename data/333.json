    "instruction": "Based on the evidence from Table 8 and Figure 16, explain the differences between the normal and uniform distributions.",
    "output": "The evidence from Table 8 and Figure 16 shows that the normal distribution has a faster rate of fall and a more rapid construction of connections compared to the uniform distribution. The normal distribution also converges much quicker in terms of colouration, with the highest and lowest colourations converging much quicker than the corresponding uniform lines. Additionally, the normal distribution reaches 0 faster than the uniform distribution, but the transition to 0 is actually slower as it takes higher radii to capture those last few outliers. Overall, these differences suggest that the normal distribution is more efficient in terms of connecting and colouring balls, but may not be as effective in capturing all outliers.",

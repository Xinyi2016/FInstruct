    "instruction": "Develop a tactical asset allocation strategy for capturing opportunities within asset classes or market segments, particularly in EM/China equity allocations.",
    "output": "In order to implement a tactical asset allocation strategy for capturing opportunities within EM/China equity allocations, we can consider utilizing a combination of the three commonly practiced strategies: direct transaction or over-the-counter swaps in cash and currency markets, baskets of locally traded futures and transactions in currency markets, and integrated futures contracts such as the MSCI EM and MSCI China Index futures. It would be important to analyze market trends and performance data to identify potential areas of opportunity and make informed decisions on which strategy to use in each situation. Additionally, regular monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio would be necessary to ensure continued success in capturing these medium-term opportunities.",

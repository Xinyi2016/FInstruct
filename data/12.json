    "instruction": "Can you provide more information about the shift in green bond issuers and what this means for the market?",
    "output": "According to data, government departments have increasingly become issuers of green bonds, rising from 7% of the total market value in 2017 to over 20% in 2023. This shift represents a significant change in the green bond market, which has historically been dominated by agencies, supranational entities, and financial institutions. The rise of government-issued green bonds is likely driven by the growing recognition of the need for government action on climate change and the potential for green bonds to fund sustainable projects. This shift may also signal a growing investor demand for green bonds issued by government departments, as investors seek to support sustainable initiatives and hold governments accountable for their environmental commitments. Overall, this trend suggests that green bonds will continue to play an important role in funding sustainable projects, and that governments will be increasingly important players in this market.",

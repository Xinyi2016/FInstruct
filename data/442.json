    "output": "The study found that there is a high correlation between the hub and authority rankings of different sectors based on all energy sources and non-renewable energy sources. The study also found that specific sectors, such as Electricity, Petroleum, Chemical and Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Metal Products, and Financial Intermediation and Business Activities, play a relevant role in both renewable and non-renewable energy sources. The study also found that other sectors, such as Transport, Mining and Quarrying, and Wood and Paper, show a different pattern according to the energy source considered. The study also found that energy and manufacturing sectors produce approximately 42% of CO2 emissions worldwide and are classified among the most polluting sectors. The study also found that the authority rankings are very similar when different energy sources are taken into account, with top ranking composed by Construction, Education, Health and Other Services, Electrical and Machinery, and Food and Beverages. The study also found that significant differences in hubs and authority rankings can be noticed, with sectors producing intermediate or final goods being characterized by higher authority scores and sectors selling primary or secondary goods being characterized by higher hub scores. The study's findings can be used to provide a suitable tool for policymakers for the assessment of alternative strategies to reduce the impact on the environment.",

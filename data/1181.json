    "output": "Estimating greenhouse-gas emissions is crucial in creating a credible plan for net-zero targets. By knowing where a company stands on carbon emissions, they can create a plan that is specific to their operations. While only a small number of companies report their emissions comprehensively, estimating emissions through data modeling has greatly improved. By considering factors such as production methods, location, and employee numbers, estimations can be made with reasonable accuracy. It's also important to understand that not all net-zero targets are created equal, so creating a credible plan with specificity is key. The pressure on corporate leaders to commit to net-zero by 2050 will only continue to grow as pressure increases from shareholders, financiers, and consumers.",

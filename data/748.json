    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of how the recently announced mortgage and housing policies, in combination with the absence of a housing-price bubble and consumer over-leverage, could affect the potential home-price drop during the coronavirus pandemic.",
    "output": "Our models suggest that if the coronavirus produces a similar GDP shock as the financial crisis, the recently announced mortgage and housing policies could have a mitigating effect on the potential home-price drop. Additionally, the absence of a housing-price bubble and consumer over-leverage may further cushion the impact. Overall, our models suggest that the home-price drop during this pandemic could be milder than that experienced during the GFC.",

    "output": "Deglobalization, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to a rethink of existing asset-allocation strategies and brought new opportunities for equity investors. Well-diversified global portfolios, quality and minimum-volatility strategies, and innovation-oriented themes have benefited from these opportunities. However, deglobalization could mean more inflation volatility and a worsening trade-off between growth and inflation. Investors may look to adapt as these forces collide and potentially forge rising global inflation. Pro-globalization trends likely helped keep inflation at bay for several decades, but if the trend toward deglobalization continues, it could cause a supply-side shock, leading to higher inflation pressure and slower long-term GDP growth. Business cycles and long-term economic growth prospects across countries may decouple, and investors must work to understand and respond to these market shifts.",

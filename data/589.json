    "output": "Based on our analysis of several metrics, it seems that the Fed has generally delivered on its key goals of low and stable inflation in recent years. While there is concern among some observers that the Fed could become less independent and political forces could exert more influence, the market doesn't seem to be overly worried about this possibility. We believe that an abrupt, politically motivated change in monetary policy could potentially lead to levels of inflation and volatility not seen in more than half a century, so it's important for the Fed to continue its track record of stability. Overall, we think that the Fed's credibility with the market remains strong and that a politically driven Fed is unlikely in the near future.",

    "output": "The micro-level dynamics of combined selfish and altruistic behavior refer to the way in which individual behavior is influenced by both selfish and altruistic motivations. This can be seen on online platforms where people may engage in behaviors such as contributing information to gain reputation and recognition, as well as to help others. The model suggests that such behavior may actually be motivated by a desire to maximize utility and the expectation of reciprocation from others. The altruistic incentive mechanism places emphasis on the performance contributions of others, leading individuals to align their actions with those of others to increase their own utility and expect similar behavior in return, a concept known as reciprocity.",

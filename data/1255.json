    "instruction": "Please analyze the current state of gender and racial/ethnic diversity on corporate boards in the US, taking into account the MSCI USA Investable Market Index and the MSCI ESG Ratings coverage. Additionally, reflect on the effectiveness of quotas and comply-or-explain rules in promoting diversity on boards.",
    "output": "According to data from the MSCI USA Investable Market Index and MSCI ESG Ratings coverage, as of Jan. 17, 2022, fewer than 30 of the 1,261 Nasdaq-listed constituents had all-male boards. While a quota may push some of these holdouts toward at least token gender diversity, boards that have already shown persistent resistance toward improving board gender diversity may not be swayed by a comply-or-explain rule alone. \n\nRegarding underrepresented-minority and LGBTQ+ directors, racial/ethnic and sexual-orientation diversity are still in their infancy compared to gender diversity, and the quota is likely to require more work from nominating committees. In the US, voluntary disclosure of racial/ethnic board diversity has been limited, and analyses based on anything other than directors\u2019 self-reported disclosures may not accurately reflect their true identity. Overall, while quotas and comply-or-explain rules may be effective in promoting diversity on boards, further effort and progress are needed to improve both gender and racial/ethnic diversity on corporate boards in the US.",

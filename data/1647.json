    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the updated economic scenarios for the coming year.",
    "output": "Our updated scenarios for the coming year include a \u201csoft landing,\u201d with a 3% gain for a diversified portfolio; \u201chard landing,\u201d with a flat return; and \u201cmild stagflation,\u201d with a 6% loss. The threat of a \u201csoft landing\u201d seems less likely now, given recent market shifts and updated economic forecasts. Under the \u201chard landing\u201d scenario, a diversified portfolio of global stocks and U.S. bonds could stay flat over the next year. The risk of entrenched inflation poses a risk to portfolio returns, with potential losses of 6% under the \u201cmild stagflation\u201d scenario.",

    "output": "The Airbus-Boeing subsidy dispute in the World Trade Organization (WTO) refers to a series of cases brought by the United States against the European Union (EU) and its member states, Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom, over alleged subsidies received by Airbus, the EU's largest aircraft manufacturer. The US argued that these subsidies gave Airbus an unfair advantage over its American rival, Boeing, in the global market for large civil aircraft.\n\nThe dispute began in October 2004 when the US requested consultations with the EU and its member states in the WTO, alleging that Airbus had received preferential loans from European governments to design and develop new aircraft models. The US claimed that this had enabled Airbus to market new products faster and at a lower cost than if loans had been granted on market terms.\n\nAfter a lengthy process, in June 2011, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruled that Airbus had received subsidies that were inconsistent with WTO rules and requested the EU to remove them. However, the EU asserted that it had removed the illegal subsidies in December 2011. The US disagreed and requested the formation of a compliance panel.\n\nIn May 2018, the Dispute Settlement Body ruled that the EU had not removed the illegal subsidies, allowing the US to take retaliatory measures. In October 2019, the WTO Arbitrator concluded that the US could apply countermeasures on $7.5 billion of imports from the EU, the largest retaliatory measure granted in the WTO history at that time.\n\nIn a parallel case, the EU also requested consultations with the US in October 2004, alleging that Boeing had received illegal subsidies from some US states. After an exceptionally long process, in March 2019, the WTO ruled that the US had not withdrawn the illegal subsidies, that those subsidies were damaging EU interests, and allowed the EU to take retaliatory measures against the US. These measures, which amounted to $4 billion of imports from the US, were implemented in November 2020.\n\nThe Airbus-Boeing subsidy dispute remains ongoing, with both sides continuing to pursue legal action in the WTO and other international forums.",

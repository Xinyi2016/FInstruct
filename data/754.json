    "output": "The absence of excessive leverage, despite the high levels of mortgage debt and total consumer debt in the U.S., could offer some level of protection against the level of mortgage defaults experienced during the GFC. This is because consumer leverage was identified as a major risk factor for the high rates of mortgage default during the crisis. However, while mortgage and consumer debt have reached or surpassed 2007 peak levels, they are currently about 20% lower than in 2007 as a percentage of nominal GDP - at 2004 levels, before the housing bubble. Therefore, the apparent absence of excessive leverage suggests that there might not be as much risk as there was during the GFC, which could potentially protect against the level of mortgage defaults seen back then.",

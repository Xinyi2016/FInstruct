    "output": "The recovery dynamics in the SNP bond market are distinct and visible. Although there is dispersion across various assets, trends can be identified. From the first SNP issuances, the market priced in a lower recovery rate compared to traditional senior bonds, reflecting SNPs\u2019 relative position in the capital structure. However, during the more risk-averse periods in 2018, the typical implied recovery rate shrank to levels close to zero. This was followed by a recent surge in 2019, indicating SNPs\u2019 increased sensitivity to risk aversion during market stress. As such, the decision to invest in SNP bonds is dependent on investors\u2019 appetite for recovery risk. Valuation and risk measures can take this risk into account to inform investment decisions.",

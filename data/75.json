    "output": "The relaxation time is a measure used in the study of wealth dynamics to evaluate the convergence of the distribution of wealth in an economy towards the steady-state distribution. It is a feature of stochastic processes that assesses how quickly individuals mix into the wealth distribution over time. When the relaxation time is short relative to the window of observation, it can be interpreted as high wealth mixing, while a long relaxation time indicates low mixing.",

    "output": "The IOM missing migrants dataset is the one exception to the trends in the dataset. The incidents in this dataset appear to be moving closer to shore on average. This is because the dataset includes deaths recorded off the coast of Libya, such as incidents where bodies wash up on shore. This means that the dataset might contain a more representative sample of incidents in the Libyan SAR zone when interception rates are high. The reason for the deaths occurring increasingly near the coast is due to two factors. First, it seems likely that LCG rescues may be more dangerous for migrants on average, due to the lack of professionalism and expertise by the LCG, and to the fact that migrants sometimes conduct risky maneuvers to avoid capture by the LCG. Second, it is also likely that a larger proportion of boats near the coast go undetected due to the decrease in NGO patrol presence, the slower response time of the LCG, and migrants\u2019 reluctance to call for help; this may lead to a growing number of sinking incidents in which bodies wash up on shore.",

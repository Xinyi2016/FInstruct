    "output": "Based on the provided information, it appears that auto loans with an original balance between USD 10,000 and USD 40,000 have been the most common. Within these loan groups, high-balance loans have performed better in subprime tiers compared to prime tiers. This can be attributed to the fact that higher-balance loans tend to have higher LTV and lower gross coupon, which can have offsetting credit effects.\n\nFor prime tiers, the gross-coupon differences were minimal for loans above USD 20,000, and default events increased monotonically with LTV as well as balances. On the other hand, for subprime tiers, LTV stabilized for loan sizes above USD 30,000, leading to improved performance as balances increased and gross coupons dropped.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there was a small group of deep-subprime loans with low coupons, short terms, and high balances that outperformed their cohort peers in all observable dimensions. This suggests that credit scores may not be the only factor in determining loan performance and that other factors, such as loan terms and structure, may also play a significant role.",

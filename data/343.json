    "output": "The results for the five part cloud in Figure 10 are fully consistent with the message. The number of balls and the number of zero connection balls are only differentiated in the time it takes to reach 500 balls. Both fall just short at 50 axes but already show the flattening of the curve seen around 20 axes in the noise cloud. The coloration varies, with a much larger range appearing when the number of axes gets larger. This is consistent with the way in which the full cloud comprises five sub-clouds with their own assumptions about mean coloration. The maximum ball size in panel (d) falls towards 1 in the same way as it does for the noise cloud, but again we see that it has not quite reached 1 at 50 axes. Total connections and average connections, panels (e) and (f), are where the biggest difference is found. Where the noise cloud showed a hump shape, the five part cloud only shows falling numbers of connections, suggesting that the BM graphs are already past the hump. Further suggestion of this comes in the ball size of panel (d) where the smallest balls are already just 1 point, contrasting with the noise cloud which has 15 axes before the smallest ball size is 1. Choosing different radii for the five part cloud is likely to yield stronger similarity. In the case of the five part cloud, we will again give examples with 5, 10, and 20 axes, and these are illustrated by the vertical dashed lines on the plot once more.",

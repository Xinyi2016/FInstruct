    "output": "By analyzing the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Index on Nov. 9 through a factor lens, we found that the size factor did not matter at all in explaining active index performance. Instead, weaker but non-negligible exposures to beta, momentum, and profitability factors explained the performance differential that day. This helped uncover the true drivers of index return and could have helped investors avoid jumping to intuitive but wrong conclusions. Thank you, George Bonne, for your contribution to this analysis.",

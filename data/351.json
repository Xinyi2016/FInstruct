    "output": "This study examines the impact of changes in border enforcement on migrant and smuggler behavior along the Central Mediterranean migration route from Libya to Italy. The researchers find evidence of a deterrence effect, with attempted crossings declining, and a diversion effect, with some migrants switching to the Western Mediterranean route. Smugglers adapted their tactics, with a strategic model showing how they balance short-term payoffs from overcrowded boats against long-term costs under different enforcement levels. The study highlights the importance of incident- and flow-level data in informing migration policy and identifying the consequences of enforcement changes.",

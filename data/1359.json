    "output": "The liquidity of bonds in an index is crucial for its replicability because the liquidity of the constituents directly impacts the cost of replicating the index. Tradable and liquidity metrics provide the best measure of a bond's liquidity, but in their absence, size is a simple and accessible proxy that is widely used in index construction. Corporate bonds with lower issuance size tend to have less liquidity and wider average bid-ask spreads in different credit market segments. Therefore, it is essential to consider the liquidity of bonds when constructing a bond index to ensure its replicability and the accuracy of its constituent representation.",

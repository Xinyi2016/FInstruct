    "output": "Syphoning off capital refers to the practice of extracting excess collateral from a hedge fund's positions, potentially leaving only the lenders with losses. This can occur when a hedge fund uses highly leveraged trading strategies, particularly in a small number of stocks. By syphoning off capital, the fund can minimize its own losses while passing the risk on to its lenders. However, this practice is not recommended as it can be seen as a form of fraud or manipulation and can have serious legal and financial consequences.",

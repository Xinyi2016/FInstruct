    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the student-loan ABS market in the last few years, and how the pandemic has impacted it.",
    "output": "The market for student-loan asset-backed securities (ABS) has seen its highest-issuance year since 2008, with the distribution gradually shifting from federal to private loans. The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) announced a payment pause with zero-interest accrual for federal student loans held by the DOE in March 2020, which has since been extended to May 2022. As a result, the forbearance level for federal-student-loan ABS remained elevated, and defaults were suppressed through mid-2021. However, as paused loans have shifted back to repayment status and enhanced unemployment benefits ended in September 2021, defaults have gradually risen back to pre-pandemic levels. Private student loans have moved out of forbearance status much faster due to less-lenient policy, although the deferment level slightly increased. The default rate for private loans was also inhibited, but these loans were prepaid much faster than before the pandemic, possibly due to refinance behavior during the low-rate market. Historically, those with federal student loans have had less incentive to refinance, due to typically lower interest rates and the DOE\u2019s forbearance protection, especially during the COVID-19 period.",

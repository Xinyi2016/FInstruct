    "instruction": "Evaluate and recommend a currency hedging policy for a real estate investor with an internationally diversified portfolio.",
    "output": "Based on the increasing exposure to currency risk in a globally diversified real estate portfolio, we recommend a selective hedging strategy that targets specific currencies where exposure is high or volatility is significant. This approach will mitigate the risk of adverse currency fluctuations without incurring significant hedging costs or sacrificing potential returns. By using hedged indexes, investors can better align their benchmarks with their own approach and accurately measure the performance of the underlying assets. It is crucial to regularly assess the hedging strategy and adjust it as needed to ensure optimal results.",

    "output": "By conducting a carbon footprint analysis on a multi-asset-class portfolio, investors can measure and manage financed emissions on their road to net-zero emissions. Comparing the financed emissions of different asset classes, sectors, and project types in the investment portfolio can provide valuable insights into decarbonization decisions. Our analysis showed that corporate bonds had the highest financed emissions among the representative indexes and portfolios, although there was significant variation between segments of the corporate bond market. To help financial institutions align with the Paris Agreement, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) has been developing a transparent and consistent methodology to report the financed emissions of investment portfolios. Our investigation of PCAF-aligned financed emissions for various asset classes, including global equities and sovereign, corporate, and municipal bonds, revealed significant variation in financed emissions across asset classes and within sectors. These findings can help inform climate-aware investors as they construct portfolios.",

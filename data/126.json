    "output": "ABM (Agent-Based Modeling) is a computational method used to simulate complex systems by modeling the interactions between individual agents. In finance, ABMs are often used to capture the behavior of financial markets and institutions, and to understand how these interactions lead to emergent properties such as price volatility and systemic risk. By running Monte-Carlo simulations and analyzing the generated time-series using econometric methods, researchers can gain insights into the operation of the model and check its consistency with general phenomena or the statistical properties of financial time-series. In the context of the paper, the authors use the JABM toolkit to build an ABM of financial institutions' choices, which depends on individual expectations, prices, and volatility. The model is then extended with the JASA API to implement an order-driven market, allowing the authors to study the impact of the mechanics of the order-book on financial stability.",

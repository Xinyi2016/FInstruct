    "output": "The new macroeconomic model shows that the relationship between interest rates and equity is driven by underlying shocks to growth and inflation expectations. Rising or falling growth expectations tend to drive equity and rates up or down together, creating a positive rates-equity correlation. On the other hand, inflation shocks have opposite effects, driving rates higher and equity down. In balanced portfolios, this relationship has historically provided a hedge in environments driven by growth expectations. However, if inflation shocks dominate, the model suggests that the hedge disappears, potentially undermining the safety of balanced portfolios, especially risk-parity strategies. Nonetheless, projections from the model suggest that conditions are still far from a flip in the rates-equity correlation, which should remain positive for the next decade in more than three-quarters of model scenarios.",

    "output": "As an equity investor, it is important to consider the potential impact of deglobalization on asset-allocation strategies. Deglobalization may lead to increased inflation volatility, slower innovation cycles, and lower long-term GDP growth. This could require a rethink of existing asset-allocation strategies, with a focus on well-diversified global portfolios, quality and minimum-volatility strategies, and innovation-oriented themes. Moreover, value strategies may outperform in high-inflation periods, while low volatility strategies may be more appropriate in moderate- and high-inflation environments. Investors may also identify new opportunities arising from the supply-side shock caused by deglobalization, such as scarcity-driven price increases or a reduction in global competition. As these market shifts continue to evolve, it is important for equity investors to remain vigilant and adapt their strategies accordingly.",

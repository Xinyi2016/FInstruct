    "output": "Upon analyzing the simulated active share and tracking error exhibits for the hypothetical portfolios, it is evident that relative risk remains a major concern for asset owners who want to embark on a net-zero journey. The portfolios in 2030 ended up with a 72% to 84% share of climate allocations, and their relative risk as measured by tracking error was not large. The active share for Investor B, who has ambitious targets, would be about 36% and tracking error about 1%, indicating that there is a relatively low level of risk associated with this portfolio. However, it is important to note that relative risk may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the investment, and it is crucial to continue monitoring and evaluating risk levels throughout the investment journey.",

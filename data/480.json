    "output": "The main distinctive feature of the model is that the agent\u2019s decision on portfolio choice and insurance demand causes nonlinear friction in the dynamics of the wealth process. This friction affects the agent\u2019s investment and insurance demand decisions, as it introduces additional costs and constraints that must be taken into account. As a result, the agent must carefully balance the benefits of insurance coverage against the costs of purchasing and maintaining it. The agent must also consider the impact of the insurable risk on their overall portfolio, as well as the potential impact of the risk on their ability to achieve their financial goals.",

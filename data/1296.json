    "output": "One possible reason for this phenomenon could be the durable business models and sustained competitive advantages of high-quality firms. These firms are likely to have well-established strategies and products that have proven success over time, allowing them to maintain their position in the market. Additionally, these firms may also have strong brand recognition, customer loyalty, and skilled employees that contribute to their sustained success.

    "instruction": "Compare the spread widening in credit markets during the 2008 global financial crisis to the recent widening caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "output": "The exhibit illustrates that the trajectory of spread widening during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to that during the 2008 crisis, with one notable difference. In 2008, there was a gradual but significant widening of spreads that began in August 2007, whereas the recent widening of spreads was sudden and unexpected. This sudden widening occurred in an economic environment that was largely positive, keeping spreads relatively tight until the pandemic hit. Despite some credit markets not experiencing losses as steep as those during the 2008 crisis, many investors are growing increasingly concerned that the pandemic could lead to further distress. The spread on U.S. investment-grade bonds has widened by over 230 bps since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, compared to the approximately 400 bps widening that occurred during the 2008 crisis.",

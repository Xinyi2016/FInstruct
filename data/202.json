    "output": "Betting behaviour of bettors in response to goals scored in a football match can be influenced by various factors, including the bookmaker's pricing strategy, the momentum of the game, and the perceived value of the bet. When a goal is scored, bettors may adjust their stakes based on their assessment of the team's chances of winning or the likelihood of a draw. For example, if a team scores the first goal, bettors may increase their stakes on that team to win, as they believe the team has a higher chance of winning. Conversely, if a team concedes a goal, bettors may decrease their stakes on that team or increase their stakes on the opposing team, as they believe the team has a lower chance of winning. Additionally, bettors may also adjust their stakes based on the momentum of the game, as they believe that the team that scores a goal will have an advantage in terms of momentum and confidence. Overall, the betting behaviour of bettors in response to goals scored in a football match can be complex and influenced by various factors, and it is important for bettors to carefully consider their bets and make informed decisions.",

    "output": "Self-similarity property refers to the characteristic of certain stochastic processes where the statistical properties of the process are invariant under changes in scale or time. In financial modeling, processes with self-similarity property, such as fractional Brownian motion, are often used to model volatility. However, these processes cannot account for both roughness and persistence in volatility, which are key features observed in financial markets. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed using Brownian semistationary processes, which allow for decoupling of short- and long-term behavior of volatility. This approach has been used in studies such as Bennedsen et al. (2021) and Gatheral et al. (2018) to model volatility and estimate the roughness parameter.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze the performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes in 2022, particularly in comparison with the MSCI ACWI Index, and provide an explanation for any differences in performance.",
    "output": "After analyzing the data, I can confirm that in 2022, the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes had superior ESG scores relative to the MSCI ACWI Index, particularly the indexes using ESG ratings for security selection or allocation. This indicates that these ESG indexes were successful in meeting individual ESG objectives, while also providing attractive risk-adjusted returns for institutional investors. The difference in performance can be attributed to the fact that institutions have fiduciary responsibilities to consider the ESG characteristics of their investments, leading to a greater demand for ESG indexes that meet their requirements. Additionally, companies with high ESG scores may perform better over the long term, as they are more likely to be resilient in the face of environmental and social challenges.",

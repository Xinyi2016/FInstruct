    "output": "The predominant subcluster in Figure 6 spans portfolios ranging from (7,4)74(7,4)( 7 , 4 ) to (9,8)98(9,8)( 9 , 8 ) and can be further subdivided into two subclusters. The first subcluster consists of portfolios ranging from (7,4)74(7,4)( 7 , 4 ) to (5,5)55(5,5)( 5 , 5 ) and the largest portfolio in this cluster is portfolio (5,9)59(5,9)( 5 , 9 ) with 45 equities and the smallest portfolio is portfolio (7,3)73(7,3)( 7 , 3 ) with 21 equities, providing the same level of risk reduction. The other subcluster contains portfolios which behave the most similar in terms of their median eigenvalues as seen by the dark blue colour. This cluster contains the largest portfolio (9,9)99(9,9)( 9 , 9 ) and the smallest portfolio is our designated portfolio (9,4)94(9,4)( 9 , 4 ). This has several important implications for equity-based portfolio management. First, there is an old adage in financial markets that 30-40 equities are sufficient for diversification and elimination of unsystematic portfolio risk. The (9,4)94(9,4)( 9 , 4 ) portfolio, composed of 36 equities nicely fits into this range. Second, it is of great relevance to retail and cost-conscious investors, that a (9,4)94(9,4)( 9 , 4 ) portfolio provides a nearly identical diversification benefit to a (9,9)99(9,9)( 9 , 9 ) portfolio, more than twice its total size.",

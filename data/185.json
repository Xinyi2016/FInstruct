    "output": "Friending bias refers to the tendency of students to form social connections with peers who share similar characteristics, such as race, income, or academic level, even when exposed to a diverse set of peers. This bias can limit the effectiveness of school integration policies, which aim to improve social mobility by exposing underprivileged students to a diverse group of peers. Despite increased exposure to different backgrounds, students may still form friendships with peers who share similar characteristics, which can perpetuate segregation in friendship networks. As a result, school integration policies may not necessarily lead to more diverse friendships for underprivileged students.",

    "output": "To achieve gender parity in the boardrooms of MSCI ACWI global index constituent companies by 2030, an annual growth rate of 2.8% is needed. Alternatively, to achieve gender parity by 2040, an annual growth rate of 1.4% is needed. It is worth noting that companies with higher female board member representation tend to have better financial performance and innovation capabilities, according to MSCI research. Gender diversity in boardrooms is also seen as a key indicator for achieving overall gender equality. While the number of companies with all-male boards is decreasing, most companies' boards are still male-dominated.",

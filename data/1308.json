    "output": "China's government has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 and expects to invest between 104 trillion and 487 trillion RMB in the next 30 years to do so. This trend may further increase the growth of green bonds in China. International investors' holdings of Chinese fixed-income securities increased by about 30% from September 2020 to September 2021, reaching approximately 3.9 trillion RMB (approximately $610 billion). Most of these holdings are currently in Chinese government bonds. As we have seen, the performance of Chinese green bonds may attract more international investors and bring benefits to investors.",

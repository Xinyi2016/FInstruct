    "output": "Our analysis suggests that the strong U.S. housing fundamentals and restored balance sheets of U.S. borrowers can indeed alleviate extension risk for MBS holders. Housing turnover and cash-out activities are the two major components of base prepayment speeds, and both are supported by the current state of the U.S. housing market. The inventory of housing units for sale has been extremely low, which has contributed to strong housing price appreciation and put a ceiling on home sales activity. However, as housing inventory normalizes, this has the potential to push up the housing turnover speed, as more homeowners choose to sell their existing homes and buy new ones. The low homeownership rate also provides room for improvement, and an increase in homeownership could potentially impact the entire U.S. housing market. Additionally, the mortgage debt-to-income ratio for U.S. households is at its lowest point since the 1980s, and the significant deleveraging that has taken place has forced U.S. households to become more financially conservative. This has prompted policy-makers to allow cash-out refinance options to pay off student debt, further supporting the strong base prepayment speed and mitigating extension risk concerns.",

    "output": "Figure 5 (a) and (b) compare the optimal allocation on the stock and straddle across different values of risk aversion level \u03b3\ud835\udefe\\gammaitalic_\u03b3. The PAMC-indirect method is used with a re-balancing frequency of 60606060 times per year, which is roughly weekly. The results show that the optimal allocation from the PAMC-indirect method is very accurate and overlapped with the theoretical solution. On the other hand, the PAMC-direct method with 60606060 re-balances per year has a substantial error, but the gap to the theoretical solution shrinks as the re-balancing frequency increases. The computational times of the PAMC-direct and PAMC-indirect methods are compared in figure 5 (c), and the PAMC-indirect method is significantly faster than the PAMC-direct method. Therefore, the PAMC-indirect method is superior to the PAMC-direct method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, and only the PAMC-indirect method is used in section 4.",

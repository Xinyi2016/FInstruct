    "instruction": "Please explain the factors that led to the switch from hedging with the Treasury curve to the use of LIBOR-based swaps and then back to Treasury-based hedging.",
    "output": "The emergence of MBS prompted hedging with the Treasury curve, but this changed in the early 2000s when the correlation between LIBOR-based swaps and MBS performance surpassed that of Treasury-MBS performance due to MBS ownership being skewed towards LIBOR-based investors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Treasury issuance was relatively scarce which presented technical issues in practice. However, after the 2008 global financial crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reduced their MBS holdings drastically, and the LIBOR scandal undermined the reliability of LIBOR-based swaps. Treasury-based hedging resumed its standard practice as an abundance of Treasury issuance and the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing/tightening affected both Treasurys and MBS simultaneously and proportionally, leading to higher Treasury-MBS correlation. As a result, investors started to rely more on Treasury-based option-adjusted modeling, although the lack of a Treasury-based volatility surface forced modelers to rely on LIBOR-based swaptions for volatility calibration, which created inconsistency in benchmarking to Treasury curves.",

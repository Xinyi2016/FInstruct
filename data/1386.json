    "instruction": "Please explain the reasons for the disconnect between equity and CDS markets in Russia and what may be driving prices in equities.",
    "output": "The lack of value from the perspective of CDS investors in Russian stocks may be due to a combination of technical-default fear, failure of the CDS auction mechanism, restrictions on trading CDS linked to the securities of sanctioned companies, and a lower perceived value of Russian equity for these investors. However, there may be value to the small fraction of investors who can invest in Russian companies that continue to operate and generate revenue. Greater price consistency may be possible if Russian markets and the economy reopen and reintegrate, and the international sanctions are lifted. To uncover a deeper picture of what is driving prices in equities, it may be helpful to search beyond a single asset class.",

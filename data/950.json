    "instruction": "Using our model for quantifying the \"bubbliness\" of individual stocks and their peers, assess the current state of the GameStop stock and its potential impact on the overall portfolio.",
    "output": "According to our crowding model, GameStop has been one of the \"bubbliest\" stocks since September 2020, and as of Jan. 27, 2021, it was still among the most crowded stocks. Therefore, it may pose a significant risk to the overall portfolio in terms of possible market bubble bursts. We recommend a careful reassessment of the portfolio's exposure to highly crowded stocks and a closer monitoring of GameStop's price movements.",

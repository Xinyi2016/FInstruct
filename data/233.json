    "output": "The study found that tariffs had a large negative effect on the value of imports, with almost all the reduction in the value of imports explained by a reduction in quantity. The change in prices was statistically not different from zero, suggesting complete pass-through of tariffs to import prices. This result is surprising given the large size of the US market, but it is in line with previous studies that found complete pass-through of tariffs to import prices during the US-China trade war. The results have important implications for trade policy, as they suggest that tariffs may not be an effective tool for protecting domestic industries, as they can lead to a reduction in the quantity of imports and an increase in prices for domestic consumers.",

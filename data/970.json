    "output": "Based on our findings, the adoption of numerous climate-related policies at the regional level following the Paris Agreement, such as the Energy Transition Law in France, the carbon tax increase in Germany and the decrease in carbon allowances in the European trading scheme, has resulted in better performance of companies with better transition risk profiles. The relative outperformance of these companies mainly occurred during the last two years, with the LCT return improving continuously over time. This suggests that climate transition risk was more likely an erosion risk rather than an event risk. Therefore, it is important to consider the longer-term potential ramifications of climate-related policies when evaluating companies' climate transition risks.",

    "output": "To analyze the underlying asset-level performance and return attribution of a pan-European investment fund using a focused, peer-group benchmark, investors should first identify the benchmark that best reflects the investment strategy and asset allocation of the fund. This benchmark should be a closely matched peer group, ideally developed by a trusted industry provider. Once the benchmark is identified, investors can compare the fund's returns to the benchmark, and analyze the contribution of various assets to the overall performance. Understanding the drivers of return can help investors make informed decisions about asset allocation, and make changes to optimize returns.",

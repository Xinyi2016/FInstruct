    "output": "The recent performance of growth strategies has been strong, but it depends on the specific type of growth strategy being used. If the strategy simply picks stocks with high growth characteristics, then the recent outperformance is out of line with historical performance. However, if the strategy targets the growth factor while controlling for other factors, then the recent outperformance has been in line with longer historical performance. Additionally, growth strategies have outperformed value strategies in recent years, but whether growth's recent performance is an anomaly in a long-term context depends on the definition of a growth strategy. For a strategy that selects stocks with the highest level of growth characteristics, the recent performance may be considered an anomaly based on historical data.",

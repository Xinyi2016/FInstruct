    "output": "Understanding a credit portfolio's performance and exposure to risk is crucial in explaining an investment strategy's merits to clients and prospects. Analysts need to comprehend the portfolio's risk exposure, identify unintended bets, and clearly communicate risk forecasts. Integrating these processes to achieve a coherent, side-by-side attribution of both risk and return creates a powerful analytical tool. A credit value strategy is an example of such a strategy. It aims to capitalize on credit risk exposure by selecting the bond with the largest spread from each duration-by-rating group in the benchmark. A bond with a high spread compared to similar bonds in its group will see its spread decrease and will mean revert towards the group average. The strategy aims to pick up alpha from spread return as spreads tighten on selected bonds (and their prices increase). In our analysis using BarraOne, we showed that the credit value strategy would have outperformed greatly from January 2003 to March 2014, and that performance improved significantly when the spread dispersion was greatest. However, a performance attribution analysis is needed to determine whether the active return derived from exposure to credit risk was a direct result of the strategy.",

    "output": "The study has found that the autoregressive parameter exhibits high persistence, and the linear and quadratic terms of GDP per capita have positive and negative coefficients, respectively, which is consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the agriculture share in value added is negatively correlated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while the industry share is positively and significantly related to GHG emissions. The study also found that the share of renewable energy consumption is negatively associated with GHG emissions, while the opposite is true for fossil fuel energy consumption and energy use. The forest area is negatively related to emissions, and financial globalization is negatively associated with GHG emissions. However, the study did not find any significant effect of domestic financial development or trade globalization on environmental damage. Finally, the study found that GDP growth is positively associated with emissions, while net capital inflows do not significantly affect GHG emissions. These findings suggest that policies aimed at promoting renewable energy, reducing fossil fuel consumption, and increasing forest area may be effective in reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, policies aimed at reducing financial globalization may also be effective in reducing emissions.",

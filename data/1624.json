    "output": "As of March 2023, 39% of the 74 banking constituents of the MSCI World Index lacked independent directors with risk-management expertise, and 18% had no independent directors with banking-industry expertise. This highlights the importance of assessing the risk-management oversight practices of banks within your portfolio to determine which ones may be well-prepared to cope with current market conditions. Additionally, the level of independent risk-management expertise on boards of EMEA-incorporated banks varied widely compared to banks in the Americas and APAC, suggesting important regional differences in risk-oversight capabilities. As a best practice for banks, directors should oversee the risk-governance framework, including regular review of key policies and controls with senior management and heads of the risk management, compliance, and internal audit functions.",

    "instruction": "Explain the effect of increasing the number of points on the BM representation.",
    "output": "As the number of points increases, the BM representation becomes more consistent and detailed. With just 200 points, the shapes are still visible, but there may be missing connections between sub-clouds. As the number of points reaches 500, the missing connections are restored, and more outliers are connected to the main shape. With 1000 points, there are even more connections and fewer outliers that do not connect. This suggests that increasing the number of points can improve the accuracy and completeness of the BM representation.",

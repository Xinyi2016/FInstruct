    "output": "According to MSCI's report, the first key point is that emerging markets are becoming increasingly important and offer significant diversification opportunities for investors. Secondly, omitting geographical or size segments can have a substantial impact on returns as a few large technology companies have accounted for a significant percentage of recent performance in developed markets. Thirdly, starting valuations and dividend growth are key factors in explaining equity market performance over long periods. Fourthly, increasing global economic and financial integration has enabled investors to seek opportunities and spread risks across national borders.

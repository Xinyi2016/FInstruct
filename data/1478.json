    "output": "After comparing the UPM 2028 and Orsted 2029 bonds, it is evident that while they have similar yields and durations, their financed-emissions estimates differ significantly. The UPM bond has a higher financed-emissions estimate, indicating that the issuer may have a larger carbon footprint compared to Orsted.

    "output": "In the given scenario, market shares are a positive function of productivities, meaning that firms with higher productivities have a larger market share. Additionally, markups are also a positive function of market shares, implying that firms with larger market shares can charge higher prices for their products. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between market shares, productivities, and markups. Furthermore, a mean-preserving spread to the distribution of productivities results in an increase in average productivity, which in turn leads to a reallocation of resources from low to high productivity firms, reinforcing the increase in aggregate productivity. However, if markups are non-decreasing in market shares, then the first term in Remark B.1, which represents the anti-competitive effect, is always non-positive. This implies that as large firms become larger, they compress output to extract higher rents, which compresses the factor share and increases fragility.",

    "instruction": "Evaluate the distribution of climate metrics across a pool of funds, and compare the MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Index to active climate funds. Provide insights on emissions intensity, implied temperature rise, and decarbonization pathway credibility.",
    "output": "Based on our evaluation, we found that assessing a pool of funds based on averages may not reflect the distribution of climate metrics across those funds. The MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Index had a lower emissions intensity than all the active funds, indicating its stronger commitment to reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, the MSCI World Climate Paris Aligned Index exhibited an implied temperature rise almost 1 degree Celsius lower than its parent MSCI World Index, showcasing its effective decarbonization strategies and fossil-fuel-based exclusions. In contrast, the active funds had a high degree of dispersion in emissions and an implied temperature rise close to that of the MSCI World Index, indicating the importance of evaluating them on an individual basis before making specific decisions. Overall, investors should consider the credibility of decarbonization pathways and emissions intensity when selecting climate funds for their portfolio.",

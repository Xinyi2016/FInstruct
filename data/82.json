    "output": "In the model, there is a complementarity between competition in product markets and the supply of factors such as labor and capital. When competition is intense, profit shares are low and factor shares and prices are high, which leads to a high supply of factors. This high factor supply, in turn, allows more firms to enter the market, leading to greater competition. This complementarity can result in multiple competition regimes or steady-states. The model shows that rising heterogeneity in firm-level productivity can make transitions between these steady-states more likely, as large, productive firms expand while small, unproductive firms contract, making it easier for smaller negative shocks to trigger firm exit and a transition to a steady-state with lower competition, capital, and output.",

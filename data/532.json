    "output": "Deglobalization is likely to break the trend of narrowing dispersion in growth rates across countries that has been observed for the past 30 years. This means that differences in growth rates between countries may widen again, leading to a market environment of lower returns, higher volatility, and growing dispersion among markets. Additionally, deglobalization can have a negative impact on overall growth rates. A reduction in correlations would make it even more important to diversify investments, both globally and across asset classes. There is evidence that correlations between developed equity markets have been trending lower since 2015, making internationally diversified portfolios more attractive from a risk-reward trade-off perspective.",

    "output": "During the peak of the current cycle, returns were primarily driven by investments in industrial assets. Specifically, larger and more prime distribution warehouses with lower yields and moderate vacancy performed particularly well, providing investors with exposure to a robust leasing market. However, when sentiment began to change, inflationary pressure led to interest rate hikes and a decrease in economic and rental growth expectations. As a result, assets of this nature began to underperform, experiencing the weakest capital growth as relatively small changes in pricing had a more pronounced effect due to shifts in yields.",

    "output": "Changes to the outlook of private-equity cash flows could have several implications for investors. One implication could be that some investors may have to adjust how they fund capital calls. Historically, investors with a mature private-asset program have been able to fund capital calls of young vintages entirely with distributions from old vintages. However, if distributions slow down more than contributions, it will be much harder to fund these capital calls solely from old vintages. As a result, investors may need to raise liquidity by selling assets from the public book at unfavorable valuations. Overall, these changes could have significant consequences for private-equity investors and require them to carefully evaluate their investment strategies.",

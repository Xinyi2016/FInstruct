    "output": "Gollier (1994) analyzed the optimal dynamic strategy of a risk-averse agent bearing an insurable risk to determine whether precautionary saving is superior to insurance in the long run. He assumed that the loss risk follows a Poisson process and that the loss function is not a function of wealth. Gollier (1994) found that the demand for insurance vanishes in the long run if the loading factor exceeds a given strictly positive critical value. He also derived the optimal strategy for capital accumulation and insurance demand in the constant relative risk aversion case and proved that compulsory full insurance reduces the rate of consumption if and only if risk aversion exceeds one.\n\nTouzi (2000) studied the stochastic control problem of maximizing expected utility from terminal wealth where the wealth process is subject to shocks produced by a general marked point process, and the agent allocates wealth between a nonrisky asset and a (costly) insurance strategy which allows reducing the level of the shocks. Touzi (2000) connected the agent\u2019s optimization problem to a suitable dual stochastic control problem in which the constraint on the insurance strategy disappears, found a general existence result for the dual problem, and obtained an explicit characterization for power (and logarithmic) utility functions and linear insurance premium.",

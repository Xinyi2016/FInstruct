    "instruction": "Summarize the main points discussed in the passage.",
    "output": "The passage discusses alternative specifications for a model presented in Section 4.3. The dependent variable used in the main paper is the differenced total number of crossings in thousands. The passage also presents three different measures of crossing behavior as the dependent variable: the differenced log number of crossings in thousands, the differenced log odds of crossing, and different specifications of the ECM. The authors experiment with different specifications of the ECM, excluding the short-run adjustment term and including lagged crossing behavior.",

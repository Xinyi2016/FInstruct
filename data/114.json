    "output": "After analyzing the data from the RAIS, I have identified a clear pattern of bunching in wages. Specifically, there is a concentration of wages around certain thresholds, with a sharp drop-off in the number of workers earning wages just above these thresholds. This pattern is consistent across various demographic groups and industries, suggesting that it is a pervasive feature of the Brazilian labor market. Further analysis of the data shows that this bunching is not driven by minimum wage laws or other government regulations, but rather appears to be the result of private sector practices such as setting wages to round numbers or using standardized pay scales. Overall, the RAIS data provides valuable insights into the nature of wage setting in Brazil and highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and consequences of wage bunching.",

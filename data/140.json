    "output": "Recent studies have shown mixed results on the effect of incumbent mergers on innovation. Federico et al. (2017, 2018) and Motta and Tarantino (2018) found negative effects in models with one-dimensional R&D effort, while Letina (2016) and Gilbert (2019) found negative effects on R&D diversity in models of project choice. Denicol\u00f2 and Polo (2018) found positive effects, and Bourreau et al. (2021) found both positive and negative effects, with the positive effects arising from allowing for horizontal as well as vertical R&D innovations. In contrast to Bourreau et al. (2021), the possibility of a positive effect in our model reflects the merged entity's ability to coordinate which projects to invest in and the existence of financial constraints, and the effect depends on the intensity of product market competition.",

    "instruction": "Explain the effect of varying window width on the response.",
    "output": "The analysis suggests that the choice of window width does not significantly affect the results. However, using a shorter window (e.g., 5 minutes) could increase statistical power, while using a longer window (e.g., 2 hours) may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio. The only exception to this pattern is for the most positive news surprises, where there is evidence of overreaction and the price drifts back more than halfway toward its pre-announcement level.",

    "output": "The sampling strategy used in the study involved selecting one village from each selected block. In the first sampling stage, the study stratified by LWE activity, which was determined by the proximity of the village to forest cover. The study found that not all villages in an LWE affected block will be affected by LWE activity, so it was difficult to get precise information on exactly which of the several hundreds of villages in a block has a history of LWE activities. Therefore, the study used an indirect approach to screen for LWE affected villages by selecting villages in LWE affected blocks that were very near to forest. The study used this strategy because forest cover has been found to be highly correlated with LWE activity at least at the district level and there is anecdotal evidence that LWE organisations mainly base their activities in dense forests as state forces find it difficult to enter these areas. The study then drew two sub-samples from these LWE affected blocks - one from areas next to forests and the other from areas away from forests. The study assigned the following number of blocks to the forest and non-forest sub-samples of the LWE based strata.",

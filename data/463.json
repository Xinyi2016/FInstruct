    "instruction": "Explain the concept of the mirroring hypothesis and how it relates to transaction cost economics.",
    "output": "The mirroring hypothesis is a theory in organizational economics that suggests that the boundaries of organizations should reflect the technical characteristics of the underlying tasks. This hypothesis is rooted in transaction cost economics (TCE), which argues that conflict resolution and information exchange are easier and more cost-effective within a firm than between firms. Therefore, organizations should allocate interdependent tasks to agents within a single firm to optimize transaction and administrative costs. The mirroring hypothesis and TCE suggest that the boundaries of organizations should be set to minimize transaction costs.",

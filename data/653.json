    "instruction": "Please provide a brief explanation of why the spread of returns between countries is wider in emerging markets compared to developed markets over short-term time horizons.",
    "output": "The wider spread of returns in emerging markets can be attributed to a number of factors. These include political instability, higher volatility, foreign exchange risk, and market inefficiencies. Unlike developed markets, which are generally more stable and predictable, emerging markets are often subject to sudden market shifts and unexpected macroeconomic events, which can lead to significant variations in returns. Additionally, the lack of information transparency and regulation in emerging markets can create opportunities for opportunistic investors to take advantage of price inefficiencies, exacerbating the variance in returns across countries.",

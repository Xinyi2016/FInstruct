    "instruction": "Please describe the process for constructing hypothetical free-float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted indexes for Japan and the U.S.",
    "output": "To construct the hypothetical indexes, we selected a fixed number of stocks from the MSCI All Cap Index constituents (our total-market proxy) for both Japan and the U.S. The stocks were chosen in descending order of their market capitalization. We then measured the changes in exposures to the low-size factor as the number of constituents increased. The exhibit below shows that low-size factor exposure increased as indexes included more stocks with smaller market capitalization. Additionally, we found that adding microcap stocks to an investable universe had a smaller impact on low-size exposure than expanding coverage to smaller stocks found in the investable universe. Finally, we quantified the difference in low-size exposure by multiplying active low-size-factor exposure by the expected low-size-factor return and estimated the contribution to be 12.5 basis points (bps) and 1.9 bps per year in Japan and the U.S., respectively, using low-size-factor returns from Nov. 30, 2007, to Feb. 26, 2021.",

    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of growth and value funds compared to appropriate style benchmarks during the study period.",
    "output": "Our analysis during the study period found that both U.S. and international growth and value funds outperformed benchmark style indexes with lower tracking error than versus market-cap indexes (with the sole exception of U.S. growth funds). This highlights the importance of aligning investment style with appropriate benchmarks to accurately measure performance. However, it is important to note that the performance of growth and value funds may vary depending on market conditions and other factors. Overall, our findings suggest that market-cap benchmarks may not be the most appropriate choice for measuring the performance of style-based investments.",

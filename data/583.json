    "instruction": "Please explain the difference between default risk and recovery risk in the context of investing in Venezuelan sovereign and corporate bonds.",
    "output": "Default risk refers to the risk that an issuer of a bond will not be able to repay its principal and interest payments to investors. On the other hand, recovery risk refers to the risk that investors will not recover the level of principal and interest they expected to recover in the event of a default. In the case of Venezuela, recovery risk is now a bigger consideration for investors as the country is on the verge of political and economic collapse. While traditional credit analysis may no longer be effective in assessing recovery risk, alternative methods such as using dynamic risk factors may provide investors with a more comprehensive view of portfolio characteristics.",

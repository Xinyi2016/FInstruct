    "output": "The asset-level attribution analysis chart for the PEPFI portfolio shows that the portfolio was constructed using assets randomly sampled from contributors' funds, subject to the index inclusion criteria. The size of the simulated portfolio was also aligned closely with the peer group's average. The analysis shows that the majority of the portfolio's returns can be attributed to security selection, while sector allocation had a minor impact. The portfolio also achieved positive excess returns compared to the benchmark.",

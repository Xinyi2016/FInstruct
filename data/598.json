    "output": "The first threat is the increased demand for recycled materials, which can conserve energy and materials. This is being driven by commitments from companies such as Colgate-Palmolive and PepsiCo to use at least 25% postconsumer recycled materials in their packaging by 2025. The second threat is the development of alternative solutions, such as bioplastics, which are made from raw materials such as corn instead of oil and gas. Finally, there is a potential shift in demand from plastics to alternatives such as paper-based packaging products. Companies like Mondi and DS Smith are developing these alternatives to compete with traditional plastic markets.",

    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the potential valuation impacts of the assumed transition scenario on the portfolios and how they compare to their respective benchmarks.",
    "output": "The portfolios all had small positive potential valuation impacts from the assumed transition scenario. Portfolio 1, with only 20 basis points of tracking-error risk to the USD benchmark, avoided a potential loss in value and experienced a small 0.06% potential gain. Portfolios 2 and 3 offered relatively small additional potential valuation upside from the assumed climate scenario but at a \u201ccost\u201d of greater tracking-error risk versus the benchmark. Similar results were observed for the EUR and GBP benchmarks. Bond issuers contributing to the positive climate valuation impacts tended to be involved in renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and green construction.",

    "output": "The text discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international trade. It notes that the pandemic has strengthened geographical relationships between countries, with preferential channels of internal exchanges in Europe and polarized trade between American and Asian countries outside Europe. The pandemic led to confused and non-cooperative responses, including export restrictions within the European Union. The text also discusses the role of the European Commission in shaping EU trade policy. The methodology used in the text has been tested on data from the second quarter of 2019, and the results are similar to those obtained for 2020. The text concludes by noting that the community structure of the world trade network is characterized by persistence, with the same communities appearing in both 2019 and 2020.",

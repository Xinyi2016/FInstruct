    "instruction": "Can you explain why airports and other uncontracted assets are more exposed to the real economy?",
    "output": "Airports and other uncontracted assets are more exposed to the real economy because they are not bound by long-term contracts with fixed revenues, and their income is directly linked to the performance of the broader economy. This makes them more susceptible to financial fluctuations and market changes, which can result in lower returns compared to contracted assets. As a result, investments in transport assets and airports may carry higher risks than investments in power and water utilities, which are typically contracted and have greater stability.",

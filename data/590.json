    "instruction": "As a mortgage trader, propose a plan of action to address the prepayment-speed misalignment challenge presented by the launch of UMBS.",
    "output": "As a mortgage trader, I propose that we closely monitor the prepayment speeds of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, and actively manage our portfolio to mitigate any potential pricing differences. We can do this by potentially investing in both agencies\u2019 securities to balance our exposure, or by utilizing hedging strategies to protect against any unfavorable movements in pricing. Additionally, we should stay informed of any updates or changes to the FHFA rules regarding prepayment-speed misalignment, and adjust our strategy accordingly. Ultimately, our goal should be to maximize returns while minimizing risks, and a proactive approach to managing prepayment-speed misalignment will be essential in achieving this.",

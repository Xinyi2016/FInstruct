    "output": "Since 2008, fixed-income markets have undergone significant changes due to financial crises. These changes have forced institutional investors to reassess their risk management frameworks and seek new approaches to better understand credit risk without relying on credit ratings. The rapid onset of crises has highlighted the need for a more forward-looking view of risk that recognizes transitions between risk regimes. Additionally, quantitative easing and negative interest rates have fundamentally changed interest-rate dynamics, making it necessary to manage exposures to each key rate individually. Basis risk has also increased due to drops in dealer inventories, and tools to manage this risk are necessary to prepare for further breakdowns in the theoretical ties between assets during times of market stress. Policy and regulatory changes have placed risk management front and center in the investment process, leading to the development of new tools to address these changes and provide insight into portfolio drivers of risk and return. These tools can be used to make more informed investment decisions, support robust risk management processes, and effectively communicate outcomes with clients and stakeholders.",

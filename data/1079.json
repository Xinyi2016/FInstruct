    "instruction": "Please analyze the loan variables of LTV, loan rates, loan terms, origination years, loan subvention, and deal issuers in order to obtain a more accurate view of auto-loan-ABS risk. Use the gain chart statistical measure to show the overall gains in modeling accuracy from using loan-level data over pool-level data.",
    "output": "After analyzing the loan variables of LTV, loan rates, loan terms, origination years, loan subvention, and deal issuers, we found that incorporating this data helped to provide a more accurate view of auto-loan-ABS risk. Using the gain chart statistical measure, we also found that using loan-level data over pool-level data led to an overall increase in modeling accuracy. As shown in the exhibit below, incorporating loan-level data resulted in higher cumulative gain percentages across the different deciles.",

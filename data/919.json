    "output": "MSCI Thematic Exposure relevance scores can provide valuable insights to help position growth funds alongside thematic funds and identify key megatrends that drove growth-fund performance. For instance, by analyzing the top themes and sub-themes in which a growth fund is heavily invested, an investor can understand the underlying drivers of its performance and compare it to other growth funds as well as thematic funds. Additionally, thematic scores can highlight any relevant risks or opportunities associated with the fund's thematic exposure, allowing the investor to make more informed investment decisions.",

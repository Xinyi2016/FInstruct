    "instruction": "Summarize the main contributions of the paper in one paragraph.",
    "output": "Our paper makes several contributions to the literature on macroeconomic coordination failures and the cyclicality of markups. First, we study the role of firm-level heterogeneity in shaping macroeconomic fragility, which is distinct from the existence of steady-state multiplicity. Second, we provide a quantification of our mechanism and link it to the 2008 crisis. Third, we speak to the literature on the cyclicality of markups, including the works of Rotemberg and Saloner (1986), Rotemberg and Woodford (1991), Jaimovich and Floetotto (2008), Bils et al. (2018), Nekarda and Ramey (2020) and Burstein et al. (2020).",

    "output": "The MSCI UK Quarterly Property Index has experienced a record pace drop during the second half of 2022, falling from its high in the second quarter of 2022 to its lowest level since the third quarter of 2009. While factor returns leading up to the recent market peak differ slightly from those leading up to the 2006 peak before the global financial crisis, the return profile has been similar through this correction. It remains to be seen how the performance of leasing and yield factors will evolve throughout the remainder of this correction. By analyzing individual assets' returns, we can gain insight into other systematic drivers of real estate returns that may aid our understanding of the current market conditions and provide hints as to what may happen next.",

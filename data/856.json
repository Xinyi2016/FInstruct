    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of the different strategies and compare them to the original sample portfolio.",
    "output": "Upon analyzing the performance of the different strategies, it is interesting to note that their risk/return characteristics remained largely unchanged. All strategies had five-year simulated annualized returns in a narrow range, and most of them slightly exceeded the original sample portfolio. Furthermore, volatilities were slightly below that of the original portfolio, indicating lower risk. Lastly, tracking errors were all approximately 1%, which shows that the strategies closely followed the original portfolio.",

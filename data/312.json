    "output": "The Technological layer is significant in the given context because it exhibits the best nestedness in terms of visual representation, with a clear triangular shape in the plot of the network\u2019s adjacency matrix. This indicates that the dynamics of the Technological environment follow the capability-based framework, where the presence of a clear diversification among nations suggests that the layer is driven by the co-occurrence of knowledge and capabilities. Additionally, the NODF of rows (countries) follows that of the Scientific layer, with the difference between the two relying on the different activities layers. The significance of the Temperature also follows the same trend, with a significant level of unexpectedness comparable to that of the Scientific layer. However, the Technological environment is less prone to create meaningful partitions or modules among nations.",

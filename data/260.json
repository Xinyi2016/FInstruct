    "output": "To develop a methodology for detecting communities in a multiplex framework, we can start by defining the different aspects of the pandemic that we want to include in the analysis, such as containment measures, COVID-19 infections data, and international trade data. We can then create a multiplex network that incorporates these different aspects and use the Estrada communicability distance to measure the distance between nodes in the network. This will allow us to identify communities of nodes that are closely connected to each other, taking into account both direct and indirect connections between nodes. We can then analyze the communities that emerge on each layer of the network separately, as well as the inter-layer connections between communities. This will allow us to gain insights into how the different aspects of the pandemic are related and how they impact the spread of COVID-19.",

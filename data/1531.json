    "output": "In addition to the industry allocations, the value and carbon efficiency factor allocations were also key contributors to the performance of the MSCI Climate Indexes in 2022. Value was a relative outperformer during this period, driven primarily by the inflationary environment and higher interest rates. This environment favored value stocks over growth stocks, and as a result, the MSCI Climate Indexes, which had smaller allocations to stocks with lower valuations, underperformed. However, the MSCI Low Carbon Leaders and Low Carbon Target indexes were less impacted by the value outperformance because they had strict controls on tracking error, which produced a lower active allocation to companies with low valuations. Ultimately, the performance of these indexes was shaped by a range of factors beyond just industry allocations, highlighting the importance of considering a variety of factors when evaluating sustainability and climate-focused investments.",

    "instruction": "Summarize the findings of the study on the relationship between intraday attention and exchange rates.",
    "output": "The study found that intraday attention has a significant effect on exchange rates, with the elasticity coefficient ranging from 0.940.940.940.94 to 1.651.651.651.65. However, when implied volatility is included directly in the model, the attention variables become insignificant, and the implied volatility shows a considerable effect, with the elasticity coefficient at 1.051.051.051.05 for the USD/RUB exchange rate and 0.940.940.940.94 and 0.960.960.960.96 for the EUR/RUB exchange rate. The study also found that changes in investors\u2019 expectations are more relevant for the EUR/RUB exchange rate, with the elasticity coefficient being 1.651.651.651.65 and highly significant.",

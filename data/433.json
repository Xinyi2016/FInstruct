    "output": "Table 11 examines the stock market's response to monetary policy surprises using different maturities to proxy for monetary uncertainty. The results show that the interaction term between the surprise and the maturity becomes redundant when using a 5-year rate, but becomes significantly positive when using a 10-year rate. This suggests that at longer maturities, interest rates reflect economic growth rather than monetary policy, and that the interaction term captures a positive cash flow channel. Overall, these results reinforce the interpretation of the cash flow and risk-free rate channels of monetary policy surprises and validate the use of the 2-year rate as a proxy for monetary policy.",

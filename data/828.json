    "instruction": "Analyze the impact of a 30% allocation on active equity funds during the full sample period and during elevated market volatility.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that with a 30% allocation, 90% of the active equity funds experienced return enhancement and risk reduction during the full sample period. The average return enhancement was 1.4% and the average net risk reduction was 2.5 percentage points. These results were even more significant during periods of elevated market volatility, where the average return enhancement was 5.1% and average net risk reduction was 3.1 percentage points. Therefore, it is recommended to allocate 30% towards active equity funds to achieve better returns and reduce risks, particularly during volatile market environments.",

    "instruction": "Summarize the key findings from Figure 13.",
    "output": "Figure 13 shows the quick decay of ball numbers and zero connected balls as the radius increases. It also evidences that the larger balls encompass a greater range of outcome values, resulting in a narrowing of the coloration range. With the growth of the balls comes not only a large maximum size but also a larger minimum size. The total number of connections and the average number per connected ball display hump shapes, with the reduction in ball numbers reducing the total number of connections and the number of possible balls a remaining ball may connect to.",

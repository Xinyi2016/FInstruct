    "output": "The rural elites identified through the methodology conform partially but not totally with the common subjective perceptions. The study is a counterpart to the findings of Cruz et al. (2017) and Naidu et al. (2017). There is substantial variation in the prevalence of clientelistic institutions within rural societies in India. The rural elites are no longer exclusively from the landlord lineage, but still hold land as a primary economic asset. However, occupational diversity has not led to productive investments. The source of power of such HHs usually straddles several spheres of rural life.",

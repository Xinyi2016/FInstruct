    "output": "When we conducted a horse race between the two approaches for tracking the same benchmark, we found that the factor-model-based approach was able to achieve almost the same returns as the standard technique, but with less tracking-error volatility. This was especially true during the COVID-19 crisis. The sheer number of constituents within municipal-bond benchmarks can pose unique challenges to funds and managers tracking them, but our factor-model-based approach was able to produce 30% less tracking-error volatility on average, and up to 50% less during the depths of the crisis. Muni investors can leverage these new tools to better understand their portfolios and ensure that the market compensates them for bearing systematic risk.",

    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of MSCI's quarterly review of principal asset classes in the first quarter of 2016.",
    "output": "In the first quarter of 2016, MSCI reviewed the principal asset classes through its factor models, which helped investors manage risks and construct portfolios. The performance of factors reflected investors' concerns about future growth and low inflation. Defensive styles outperformed growth-sensitive factors due to the volatile equity markets. The quarter showed dispersion in the performance across industry factors, with precious metals and gold topping the list. Factor returns for bonds reflected investors' perception of a slowdown in global growth. Credit spread factors changed little over the quarter, with the exception of a divergence in spreads between high-yield and investment-grade issuers in the US. The Brazilian real saw the strongest appreciation against the US dollar, while the British pound depreciated. The energy factor dipped, and precious metals outperformed all other sectors due to macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility.",

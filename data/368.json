    "output": "In 2018, Libya\u2019s request to formally establish a SAR zone was approved by the international community. This recognition allowed the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) to coordinate search and rescue efforts within their designated zone, which includes the territorial waters within 12 nautical miles of the Libyan coast, as well as the contiguous zone between 12 and 24 nautical miles from shore. Prior to this formal recognition, the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) in Rome coordinated rescue efforts off the coast of Libya, and rescued migrants were typically taken to Europe. However, as of October 2016 the EU began training the LCG, and as of May 2017 MRCC Rome began assigning rescues to LCG boats. This policy shift was formalized by the Malta Declaration in February 2017, in which the EU committed to support the training and capacity building of the LCG for the purpose of migration enforcement.",

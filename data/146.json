    "output": "R&D spending is a common measure used in the innovation literature to assess the probability of innovation. The idea is that the more a firm invests in research and development (R&D), the higher the likelihood that it will discover new innovations. However, this approach can be misleading, as demonstrated by the results of the study. The study shows that when competition is not soft and financial constraints are severe, R&D competition can lead to both higher R&D costs and lower innovation probability than a research joint venture (RJV).\n\nIn an RJV, the firms can achieve the same innovation probability as competitive firms with lower costs by avoiding duplication of R&D efforts. This means that the RJV invests weakly less than its total budget, which reduces R&D costs without sacrificing innovation probability. By contrast, in R&D competition, both firms invest more than their available budget in R&D, which leads to higher costs and lower innovation probability.\n\nIn summary, R&D spending is not always a reliable measure of innovation probability, as it can be influenced by factors such as competition and financial constraints. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors when assessing the effectiveness of innovation policies.",

    "output": "Estonia, as a representative CEE catching-up economy, has a distinctive NIS where more firms innovate through the \u2018doing, using and interacting\u2019 (DUI) mode of innovation rather than \u2018scientific and technologically-based innovation\u2019 (STI). This is evident from the fact that about 30% of the firm-years have positive R&D expenses, but 74% of the firm-years have innovated to introduce at least one new product in the market or a new process. This suggests that in Estonia, investments in R&D are neither necessary nor sufficient for firm innovation. The outcome has implications for the productivity implications of innovative activities and the measurement of technological change in middle-income economies.",

    "output": "Sector investing in the Chinese equity market offers several benefits for investors. Firstly, there is low correlation amongst sectors, particularly between cyclical and defensive sectors, which provides diversification. Additionally, there are differences in fundamentals, such as earnings growth and dividend yield, which allows investors to choose specific sectors that align with their investment goals. Lastly, there are geographic differences that reflect differences in firms' sources of revenue, which can help investors identify sectors that are more domestically-oriented or have exposure to the global economy.\n\nOne aspect unique to Chinese equities is the large number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which affects the fundamental profile of SOEs compared to privately-owned enterprises. As of September 2018, SOEs had higher profitability and paid more of their earnings out as dividends than their private counterparts, but they also had poorer growth prospects. Additionally, investors have fled the technology and consumer discretionary sectors in favor of energy and utilities due to lower volatility and higher exposure to quality and yield factors.\n\nInvestors should also be aware of concentration risks from mega-cap stocks, such as Alibaba, which can affect the performance of specific sectors. However, overall, the low correlation, differences in fundamentals, and geographic differences make sector investing a viable option for investors in the Chinese equity market.",

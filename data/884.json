    "output": "The pandemic-era trends such as social distancing, remote working, and changing mobility have the potential to affect the growth of property income and investment returns in large, global cities. Global gateway cities have been the preferred choice for institutional property investors to diversify portfolios and generate capital growth after the 2008 global financial crisis. However, the outperformance of these cities has put downward pressure on their yield, leading to a larger percentage of purchase expenditure flowing to secondary office markets since 2017, a trend that could have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The poll conducted in August 2021 shows that most respondents favored a hybrid return-to-work approach, signaling a potential shift in the demand for office properties in these global gateway cities. It remains to be seen if the superior capital growth of these cities was built on fundamental income growth or driven by the ability to attract a disproportionate share of capital flows. As such, further analysis of purchase activity in the U.S. office market is required to determine whether investors have been allocating more capital to secondary markets and how it may affect income growth and investment returns for office property in global gateway cities.",

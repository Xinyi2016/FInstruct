    "instruction": "Analyze the bond and equity-market reactions since the U.S. elections and provide insight on investor views of inflation, credit, and economic growth.",
    "output": "The strong rally in equities and tightening in corporate and municipal credit spreads suggest that investors are anticipating robust economic growth with improving credit conditions. However, Treasury yields and market-implied inflation have not shown significant changes since pre-election levels, indicating that markets may not expect a significant increase in inflation. The lack of direction in the Treasury market stands in contrast to the bullish reaction seen in equity and credit markets. Some investors may believe that future economic growth will occur without driving up inflation, while others may be less bullish on the strength of the U.S. economy compared to equity and credit investors. The majority of respondents in the MSCI Investment Decision Survey plan to increase allocations to U.S. equities, possibly reflecting the belief that fixed-income returns are asymmetric in the current low-yield environment, with a greater chance of a significant increase in yields than a decline. Respondents are cautious about credit spreads, which may not be sustainable given the diminished prospects for large fiscal stimulus with a divided government.",

    "instruction": "Can you summarize the key takeaways from the article on global equity valuations?",
    "output": "The article states that the U.S. bull market is now the longest in history, leading to strong global equity returns over the 10 years since the financial crisis. While valuations are high, they have not reached extreme levels. There are distinct valuation characteristics across regions, sectors, and factors that may create potential investment opportunities. Looking at regions, the U.S. appears overvalued, while emerging markets and Europe remain in the 50s and 40s ranges, respectively. Japan appears relatively undervalued. Some sectors such as telecom services and financials are close to their lowest relative valuations, while the information technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials sectors are all close to their peak relative valuations. Defensive factors, such as quality, high dividend yield, and minimum volatility are currently priced at expensive relative valuations, while cyclical factors, such as enhanced value and equal weighted are valued cheaply.",

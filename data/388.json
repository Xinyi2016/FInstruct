    "output": "The process of deriving a stochastic dynamic model for the top GB distribution involved identifying an SDE whose steady-state distribution was similar to the Beta distribution. This led to the discovery of the modified Beta (mB) distribution, which was then used to construct an mGB distribution using a change of variable to the power of the variable. Additionally, an SDE was derived from the mB SDE via the same change of variable, resulting in another mGB distribution as its steady-state distribution. Both mGB distributions have key features of the traditional GB distribution and its generalization, but seem to describe random variable distributions better. There is very little numerical difference between the two mGB distributions, except that the former has a far simpler analytical form than the latter.",

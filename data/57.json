    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the key findings from the study on the impact of digital credit on subjective well-being.",
    "output": "The study found that access to digital credit improves subjective well-being more for individuals with lower credit scores and those who are unemployed. This differential effect is sufficient to close the gap in subjective well-being between unemployed and employed, and more than closes the gap by credit score. The study also found larger impacts on applicants who own a business, but little difference in impact by gender. These findings should be viewed speculatively as they were not part of the pre-registration plan and the heterogeneous impact estimates are generally not statistically significant.",

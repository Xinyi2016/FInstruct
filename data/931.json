    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the listing and private real estate market reactions during the early stages of the pandemic.",
    "output": "During the early stages of the pandemic, the listed real estate markets experienced extreme reactions while movements in private-market valuation were relatively muted. Lack of frequent valuation or pricing information has made it difficult for private real estate investors to find market intelligence, leading to extra-careful attention to pricing indicators. The pandemic-related uncertainty, combined with illiquidity and pricing uncertainty, has made life more challenging for investors in the private real estate market.",

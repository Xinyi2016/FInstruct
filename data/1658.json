    "output": "Our analysis shows that while minimum volatility strategies may not have always outperformed during a rising-rate cycle, it has delivered a persistent risk-reduction benefit. The minimum volatility strategy's exposure to the equity factor remained stable during varying interest-rate regimes, while its exposure to the bond factor when rates rose was less than half of the exposure when rates declined. This implies that the minimum volatility strategy was less sensitive to interest-rate changes in a rising rate environment. Additionally, during a rising-rate regime, the bond factor caused only a negligible performance drag of -16 basis points per annum, while contributing about 1.1% of positive performance during a declining rate regime. Overall, the minimum volatility strategy performed in line with the market, returning a negligible -12 bps from 1963-1981, when the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose by an average of 63 bps per year. The risk-reduction benefit of the minimum volatility strategy has prevailed throughout the 54-year interest-rate history, reducing risk in both interest-rate regimes by an average of 18%, compared to the cap-weighted benchmark. Therefore, institutional investors who attempt to time the strategy need to be reminded of the existence of market volatility in both rate environments and take a long-term approach to investing in the minimum volatility strategy.",

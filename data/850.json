    "instruction": "Evaluate the impact of climate risk mitigation on the risk and return characteristics of our equity portfolio.",
    "output": "While this case study only applies to a single portfolio, there is promising research by MSCI and others that provide potential risk-mitigation scenarios for climate risk in equity portfolios. It is still early days in terms of limiting climate risk within these portfolios, but further research can help determine how much climate risk can be mitigated without disturbing the underlying risk and return characteristics.",

    "output": "When analyzing the impact of including smaller stocks on tradability, we used the \"days to trade\" measure of the index. This measure takes into account the average number of days it takes to trade the entire market value of a stock. With a fund size of USD 10 billion and a daily trading limit set at 20% of daily liquidity, including smaller stocks in the index could potentially increase the \"days to trade\" measure. This is because smaller stocks typically have lower liquidity compared to larger stocks. As a result, buying or selling a large amount of shares in these smaller stocks may take longer to execute, which could contribute to higher trading costs and potentially lower overall tradability of the index. Therefore, when considering the inclusion of smaller stocks in an index, it is important to weigh the potential benefits of diversification against the potential impact on tradability.",

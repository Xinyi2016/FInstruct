    "output": "According to the information provided, there was a reversal in global factors over September, as market volatility increased. The chart above indicates that there was a gradual shift from momentum into value, which could have implications for investment decisions. While momentum and value both delivered positive active returns in the previous quarter, the shift towards value in September suggests that this factor may be gaining more prominence in the market. This could mean that investors may need to adjust their investment strategies accordingly, and focus more on companies that exhibit value characteristics, rather than simply chasing momentum. Additionally, the fact that value performed well in emerging markets and Asia ex Japan, and low size performed well in Europe, may offer further insights into where investors should be focused going forward.",

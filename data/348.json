    "output": "The current paper shares similarities with [3, 6, 7] in terms of methodology. Specifically, [3] used MOP to solve utility maximization problems with both investment and consumption, which is similar to the argument used in the current paper to prove that each solution to some mean field FBSDE corresponds to an NE of (1.4). However, the strategies used in [3] are not suitable for portfolio games, according to [8, Remark 2.2]. The DPP used in the current paper is adapted from [6, 7], where all players traded common stocks and there was no consumption. This is a key step in proving the uniqueness result. The most similar paper to the current one is [8], where the authors studied mean field portfolio games with only investment in a general framework. The current paper can be considered as a continuation of [8]. From a modeling perspective, the current paper is similar to [12], where all market parameters become time-independent, the model reduces to the one in [12]. Using a PDE approach, [12] obtained a strong equilibrium, which was proved to be unique among all strong ones. By the current paper's more probabilistic approach, it is concluded that the strong equilibrium obtained in [12] is unique in the essentially bounded space, thus answering the question proposed in [12].",

    "instruction": "Please explain the importance of having a historically calibrated MBS model.",
    "output": "A historically calibrated MBS model is important because it helps investors to consider various stress scenarios and assess information embedded in market dynamics. This is critical in times when historical prepayment-performance data is lacking, as it provides a validated tool to navigate through uncharted territory and make informed investment decisions. By relying solely on historical data, investors may overlook important market dynamics and fail to consider potential stress scenarios, which could lead to significant losses. A calibrated MBS model validated through the transition period of 2022 can therefore provide valuable insights and help investors better understand market behavior.",

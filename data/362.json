    "output": "Based on the data from Figure C.7 and Figure 6(a) and (b), smaller boats with less than 50 passengers and wooden boats appear to be the most successful in reaching the Frontex operational area. Smaller boats have an advantage in reaching the Frontex operational area, with this advantage being most pronounced for boats with less than 50 passengers. Wooden boats are also more successful in reaching the Frontex operational area, likely due to their seaworthiness. However, it is worth noting that the dataset also includes a number of \"other\" boat types, which on average are more successful in reaching the Frontex operational area, but are not analyzed due to their heterogeneity and relatively small portion (11%) of incidents.",

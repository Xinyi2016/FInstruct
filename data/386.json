    "output": "The Generalized Beta family of distributions is a widely used distribution in econometrics and econophysics, particularly for understanding distributions of income and wealth. The family has been extended to include distributions with scale-free, power-law tails, which may be of particular interest in modeling economic exchange. The GB family has numerous applications in various fields, including physics, mathematical finance, and cognitive psychology. A very general yet simple model of stochastic volatility yields a GB2 steady-state distribution, which is of particular importance to this work.",

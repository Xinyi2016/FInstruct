    "output": "Our stress test indicates that a 60/40 model portfolio could lose about 12% and global equities could lose slightly under 20% compared to the baseline scenario. However, Treasury bonds could gain 6%, partially offsetting the equity losses. Both corporate investment-grade and high-yield bonds could suffer market-value losses as credit spreads widen, but those losses could be partially offset by the decrease in yields. As of March 3, this hypothetical portfolio could drop 7% under our scenario. If the global economy recovers from short-term pain caused by the pandemic, the market could bounce back once uncertainty dissipates. However, if long-term growth and corporate earnings take a hit, the market could continue to be impacted for a longer horizon. By 2030, our model shows that the cumulative impact on U.S. equity could improve to -3% (from -22%) with only a short-term shock, but could only rebound to -10% with both short- and long-term shocks.",

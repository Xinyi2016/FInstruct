    "instruction": "Can you explain how the investor in the exhibit used macro-rotational strategies in their investment decisions?",
    "output": "Sure! This investor combined macroeconomic analysis, bottom-up fundamental analysis, and quantitative signals to create a country long/short strategy. By using index-level price-to-forward-earnings ratio and three-month risk-adjusted momentum, they were able to rotate between long and short positions in a basket of EM and Asia single-market indexes. This allowed for more complex investment decisions based on multiple factors.",

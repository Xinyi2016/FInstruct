    "output": "The concept of causal effect refers to the relationship between a cause and its effect. In the given scenario, the causal effect of interest is the relationship between household wealth and entrepreneurial entry. The seminal paper by Evans and Jovanovic (1989) argued that an increase in household wealth should lead to an increase in entrepreneurial entry. However, establishing a causal relationship between the two variables is challenging due to the possibility of reverse causality, where being an entrepreneur may lead to an increase in household wealth, or the presence of confounding factors that affect both household wealth and entrepreneurial entry. To establish a causal relationship, one needs to identify an exogenous change in household wealth that is unrelated to business opportunities.",

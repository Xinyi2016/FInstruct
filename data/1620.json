    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the regional differences in the number of independent risk-management experts on bank boards.",
    "output": "Our analysis found that EMEA-incorporated banks had the highest share (21%) of boards without any independent risk-management experts. On the other hand, banks incorporated in the Americas and APAC had a majority of boards with at least one independent director with risk-management expertise. However, EMEA had the highest levels of bank boards with three or more independent risk-management experts (15%), as well as a higher level of bank boards with two independent risk-management experts (24%). This suggests that EMEA banks have a wide range of independent risk-oversight capabilities.",

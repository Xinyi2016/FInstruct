    "instruction": "Analyze the table below to determine how different currencies have been affected by hedging and to identify appropriate benchmarks for allocating currency risk management.",
    "output": "Based on the table provided, it is evident that hedging can either improve or reduce returns based on the currency. Australian investors who hedged their exposure may have found a local-currency index easier to outperform, while the converse was true for Japanese investors. It is therefore important for investors to account for such dynamics in their performance attribution to gain a more accurate assessment of the drivers of their portfolio returns. Selecting an appropriate international benchmark that aligns with the investor's chosen policy for currency risk management is also critical in this regard, as it helps investors make informed allocation decisions and account for any potential impacts on overall portfolio and benchmark returns.",

    "output": "Thank you for the task instruction. We will use geospatial tools to identify any biodiversity-related risks associated with a company's operations based on their location. By overlaying a company's data on asset location and ownership with biodiversity metrics, we will be able to detect if a company has operations in a biodiversity-sensitive area. We understand that having operations in such an area does not necessarily mean that the company is generating adverse impacts on the biodiversity of these geographies. However, if we have exposure to flagged companies, we will combine the screening metrics with an in-depth review of their practices for managing biodiversity risk or involvement in controversies to make informed decisions about their insurance coverage.",

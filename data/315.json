    "output": "Economic Complexity is a measure of the diversity and sophistication of the productive capabilities of a country or region. It is based on the idea that economic growth and development are driven by the ability to create and trade a diverse range of goods and services. In the context of scientific networks, Economic Complexity can be used to analyze the structure of scientific collaboration and the distribution of scientific knowledge. The structure of scientific networks can be seen as a reflection of the diversity and specialization of scientific research, with more complex networks indicating a greater degree of specialization and diversity. The quality of the scientific layer in the context of Economic Complexity is determined by its heterogeneity, with more heterogeneous networks being considered of lower quality. This heterogeneity can be caused by a variety of factors, including differences in research funding, the availability of resources, and the level of international collaboration. The introduction of more stable metrics, such as log-citations, can help to address this issue by providing a more accurate measure of the quality and impact of scientific research.",

    "output": "The dynamic properties of the 1975, 1990 and 2007 economies were compared by examining the ergodic distribution of log output. The distributions were centered around the highest mode, with the horizontal axis representing output in percentage deviation from the highest steady-state. The comparison revealed three important observations. First, while the ergodic distribution of the 1975 economy was unimodal, the other two economies featured bimodal distributions, implying that these two economies were characterized by multiple (stochastic) steady-states. Second, relative to the 1990 economy, the 2007 model featured a larger probability mass on the left, suggesting that the economy on average spent more time on the lowest regime, characterized by lower competition and output. Third, in the 2007 distribution, the two steady-states were also closer to each other, meaning that transitions were less pronounced in 2007 but substantially more likely in 2007 than in 1990. The 1975 economy, instead, behaved similarly to a standard RBC model, and could suffer temporary recessions but these would not have long-lasting consequences.",

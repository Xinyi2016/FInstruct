    "instruction": "Please analyze the carbon footprint of the MSCI indexes and the effect of improving liquidity by increasing the minimum size for bonds and selecting firms with larger total bond liability.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we measured the carbon footprint of the MSCI indexes by emission intensity using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials standards. We found that improving liquidity by increasing the minimum size for bonds in the index improved the carbon footprint of the MSCI IG indexes, but had a less pronounced effect on the MSCI HY indexes where issuance was more homogeneous. Additionally, selecting firms with larger total bond liability improved the emission profile of the index but increased concentration in the index as well. However, overall, there was little evidence that improving liquidity of the constituents of the index worsened the emission profile of the hypothetical corporate-bond index or interfered with decarbonization targets. In fact, in the USD and EUR IG universes, selecting for bonds with large amounts outstanding improved the emission profile.",

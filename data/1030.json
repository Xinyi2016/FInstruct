    "instruction": "Read the paper on the comparison of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) and their backtests. Discuss the significance of the research findings.",
    "output": "The paper investigates the debate surrounding the use of VaR and ES as risk measures in financial institutions. The research findings suggest that ES may be a better measure of risk during periods of systemic turmoil, as it captures extreme losses that VaR may not. Additionally, the paper introduces three model-independent backtest methodologies for ES that prove more powerful than the standard Basel VaR test. The authors show that ES can be backtested and possesses the required mathematical property of elicitability, opening the door to a transition from VaR to ES. The significance of the research findings lies in the potential for a more accurate and comprehensive measure of risk in the banking industry.",

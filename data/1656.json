    "output": "The low interest rate environment is causing institutional investors to seek higher yields, but with the Federal Reserve planning to tighten rates in 2017, many are reducing their interest rate exposure. Leveraged loans are becoming a popular alternative to high-yield bonds for fixed income investors as they have outperformed high-yield bonds on a risk-adjusted basis over the last five years. Leveraged loans are less exposed to rising rates as they have floating-rate coupons, making them more secure in a changing interest-rate environment. However, they have their own risks, such as the possibility of borrowers calling in their loans before maturity. The MSCI leveraged loan model uses a decade of loan performance data to calibrate loan-specific prepayment forecasts and suggests spread durations are considerably lower for loans than for high-yield bonds, but investors should be aware of the possibility for increased spread volatility and reduced calls that would extend cash flows further into the future.",

    "output": "Poorer countries are more vulnerable to climate change for three reasons. First, poorer countries have a higher share of their economic activity in sectors, such as agriculture, that are directly exposed to the vagaries of weather. Second, poorer countries tend to be in hotter places, which makes adaptation more difficult as there are no analogues for human behavior and technology. Cities in temperate climates need to look at subtropical cities to discover how to cope in a warmer climate, and subtropical cities at tropical ones. The hottest cities will need to invent, from scratch, how to deal with greater heat. Third, poorer countries tend to have a limited adaptive capacity, which depends on a range of factors, such as the availability of technology, the ability to pay for those technologies, the political will to mobilize resources for the public good, and the government\u2019s competence in raising funds and delivering projects. All these factors are worse in developing countries.",

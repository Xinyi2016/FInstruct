    "output": "China has become increasingly prominent in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index since June 2017, representing about 28% of the index at that time. With the inclusion of 472 large- and mid-cap China A shares, China's weight rose to around 33% of the index by November 2019, surpassing the combined weight of South Korea, Taiwan, and India. China A shares' weight in the MSCI China Index also rose exponentially, representing around 12% in less than two years. Furthermore, China's risk contribution to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index went up from 27.5% to 38.6% on an unhedged basis. Despite the low correlation between China A shares and emerging markets, their market-capitalization shares have contributed greatly to their respective indexes. As a result, China's growing influence in the global economy is becoming increasingly evident.",

    "output": "Thrift institutions, also known as savings and loans associations, are financial institutions that specialize in accepting deposits and making mortgage loans for consumers to purchase homes. Thrifts have historically played a significant role in mortgage finance, as they offer a convenient and accessible means for borrowers to secure financing for their home purchases. Thrift institutions' mortgage lending activities are regulated by federal laws and overseen by regulatory agencies such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As a result of their focus on mortgage lending, thrifts are closely tied to the overall health and stability of the housing market and the economy as a whole.",

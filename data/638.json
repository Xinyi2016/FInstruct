    "instruction": "As an investor, you want to evaluate a company's potential for growth based on their human-capital utilization. Write a letter to the SEC expressing your support for the proposed requirement of adding human-capital \"measures or objectives\" in disclosures.",
    "output": "Dear SEC,\n\nI am writing to express my full support for the proposed requirement of including human-capital \"measures or objectives\" in company disclosures where such information would be material to an understanding of the registrant's business. As an investor, I believe that this would greatly enhance the transparency and accuracy of the information available to us and help us make more informed decisions about the companies we invest in.\n\nFurthermore, I strongly agree that this measure has the potential to transform how businesses disclose data on workforce composition and become a useful tool in evaluating a company's potential for growth. I am particularly encouraged by the emphasis on the \"attraction, development, and retention of personnel\", as these are critical areas that can greatly impact a company's success.\n\nFinally, I believe that the inclusion of diversity as a key element of human-capital utilization could be a significant and positive development for the business community. By highlighting the importance of diversity, companies may become more proactive in promoting and supporting diversity initiatives, which could ultimately benefit all stakeholders.\n\nThank you for considering my input on this important matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]",

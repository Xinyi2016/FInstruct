    "output": "The behavioral model of the driver used in the congestion control problem on a highway segment is a cascaded system with the behavioral model as in Equation\u00a01.3. This model is similar to the one used in Equation\u00a01.2-1.3 and is based on the concept of a driver's utility function, which takes into account factors such as travel time, travel cost, and comfort level. The model is used to determine a dynamic tolling price strategy that leads to a more efficient congestion control.",

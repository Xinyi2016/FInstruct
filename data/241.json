    "output": "The large deviations theory for small-time diffusion processes is a powerful tool that allows us to obtain analytical results for the short-maturity asymptotics of Asian options in the local volatility model with an associated L\u00e9vy subordinator. This theory provides a way to study the behavior of a stochastic process as the time horizon becomes very small. By applying the large deviation principle, we can obtain the corresponding large deviations for the small time arithmetic average of the diffusion process and formulate a robust expression to the asymptotic behavior for the out-of-the-money Asian call and put options. The asymptotic exponent obtained is the rate function from the large deviation principle, which itself is a complex and non-trivial variational problem. The advantage of using the large deviations theory is that it allows us to obtain explicit expressions for the short-maturity asymptotics of Asian options, which can be used to price these options more accurately. In this work, we will use the large deviations theory to study the behavior of the underlying local volatility model, which is driven by both a Brownian motion and a L\u00e9vy subordinator. This model is closely connected to a generalized Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BN\u2013S) model and has been successfully implemented in recent literature for derivative and commodity market analysis.",

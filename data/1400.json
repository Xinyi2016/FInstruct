    "instruction": "Can you explain the difference between primary and secondary carbon markets and how regulated entities participate in both markets?",
    "output": "Carbon allowances in the primary market are either auctioned or distributed to regulated entities for free by regulators to ensure compliance with their emission limits. Regulated companies can then trade these allowances in the secondary market using spot or derivatives contracts such as futures, options and swaps, based on their emission requirements. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers exchange existing allowances to meet their compliance needs. Therefore, regulated entities participate in both primary and secondary carbon markets, with the former serving to allocate allowances to companies for free or at a fee and the latter allowing for trading of existing allowances.",

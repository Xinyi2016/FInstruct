    "output": "Based on our analysis using MSCI's Private Equity Model and Burgiss data, private capital strategies in Europe and Asia have generally performed well over the past 5 years, with positive risk-adjusted excess returns and diversification benefits relative to public markets. This is in line with the trend of record inflows into private markets in recent years, as investors seek high-returning assets with low correlations to traditional public asset classes. Therefore, private capital has delivered on its promise of diversification and high returns for investors.",

    "output": "Information asymmetry refers to the situation where one party in a transaction has more information than the other. In financial markets, this can occur when one trader has access to more information about a security than another trader. This can lead to an imbalance in the pricing of securities, as the trader with more information can use it to their advantage to make more informed decisions. This can result in the trader with less information being at a disadvantage, as they may not have all the information they need to make an informed decision. This can lead to inefficiencies in the market and can affect the overall pricing of securities.",

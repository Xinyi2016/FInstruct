    "output": "To measure bias in the effort study, the experimental conditions were grouped into eight categories based on the psychological phenomenon they measured. Some categories were then reverse-coded, and bias was measured as the expected difference between the behavioral scientists' predictions and the actual number of points scored in each category, with the exception of the framing effects category, where bias was measured as the difference between loss-framed and gain-framed conditions.",

    "output": "In order to achieve and maintain gender parity on corporate boards, we need to first identify the current gender makeup of our boards and set goals for increasing female representation. This could involve seeking out and recruiting qualified female candidates, as well as implementing mentorship and leadership programs to help women advance to executive positions. Additionally, we could consider implementing policies that promote work-life balance and support for women in their careers. It will be important to regularly track and evaluate progress towards gender parity to ensure that we are moving in the right direction.",

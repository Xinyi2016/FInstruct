    "instruction": "Write an update on the progress made in securitized products' transition from LIBOR in 2021 and the challenges still faced by investors.",
    "output": "In 2021, the transition from LIBOR to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) in securitized products has made significant progress, including the cessation of LIBOR indexes and the fixing of fallback spreads. However, the main challenge that investors are currently grappling with is the fallback language for \"tough legacy\" products that will not be converted or amended before LIBOR cessation. New York state\u2019s newly enacted law and a federal law under consideration have been proposed to address this issue. To address this challenge, securitized products\u2019 LIBOR-transition analytics have included application of the SOFR index and SOFR benchmark curve, as well as fallback options. Valuation of many legacy LIBOR securities is generally converging among many transition options. Thus, while progress has been made, investors continue to face the challenge of navigating the LIBOR-SOFR transition and its impact on their analytics.",

    "output": "The lengthening of MSCI's model-based option-adjusted duration (OAD) in the second half of 2022 can be attributed to several factors including a drastic slowdown in existing-home sales and cash-out activities, leading some investors to raise concerns about the model's base-speed assumptions being too fast. MSCI's prepayment-error tracking shows the model slowed down in sync with realized prepayment, with an overshooting of potentially 1 CPR in the past three months. Furthermore, the QT tension and convexity volatility, such as one-month x 10-year swaption volatility, spiked to almost 160 bps in the middle of 2022, causing the duration gap to increase significantly. However, the recent moderation in QT uncertainty and convexity volatility, with one-month x 10-year swaption volatility dropping to 135 bps, has narrowed the duration gap. The current market indicates that MSCI's model projection for base speeds is in line with market expectations.",

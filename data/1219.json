    "output": "Historically, companies with higher leverage have faced headwinds when the cost of capital rises. This can be particularly challenging for companies that rely on their ability to source goods from lower-cost and often international suppliers to maintain healthy margins. In addition, cross-border capital flows could be impacted, which could limit access to credit for certain regions. However, companies with durable business models and sustainable competitive advantages may be more resilient in a deglobalization scenario. It is possible that with less reliance on global supply chains, national economies may require a higher level of automation to achieve greater domestic production. This could mean that manufacturing becomes highly automated and highly customizable to meet customer needs.",

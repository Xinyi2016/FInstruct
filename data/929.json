    "instruction": "Can you explain the relationship between the strong quarterly performance of global cyclical sectors and the value factor?",
    "output": "According to the article, the strong quarterly performance of global cyclical sectors, such as financials, materials, and energy, may suggest that investors are increasingly confident in a synchronized global recovery in 2021. Additionally, these sectors, except for industrials, have high exposure to the value factor. This means that not only did value stocks outperform within these sectors, but value sectors as a whole also outperformed other sectors. This is indicated by the green color-coded positive value exposure in the exhibit provided in the article.",

    "output": "The study investigates the impact of interconnection between countries on the need for electricity storage in a 100% renewable energy scenario for central Europe. The researchers used a cost-minimizing open-source capacity expansion model and a factorization method to disentangle the effect of interconnection on optimal storage through distinct channels. The results showed that geographical balancing through electricity grids can significantly reduce the need for storage by around 30%. The study found that the differences in wind power profiles between countries are the main driver of this effect, explaining around 80% of the reduction in storage needs. Differences in solar PV capacity factors, load profiles, or country-specific capacities of hydropower together explain up to 20% of the effect. The study concludes that geographical balancing through interconnection with neighboring countries is an important option for increasing power sector flexibility and reducing the need for electricity storage in renewable energy systems.",

    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the MSCI Climate Change Index and the MSCI Climate Paris Agreement Aligned Index, and explain how they are aligned with net zero climate goals.",
    "output": "The MSCI Climate Change Index and the MSCI Climate Paris Agreement Aligned Index both aim to align with net zero climate goals. As of June 1st, they have achieved a low carbon footprint and high green revenue compared to the MSCI ACWI Index. Typically, to meet these goals, the relevant indices will deviate from the MSCI ACWI Index. As seen in the table, both climate indices have historically underweighted value stocks. Similarly, when looking at sector allocations, both climate indices have underweighted energy and overall overweighted the information technology sector (which has a lower carbon footprint).",

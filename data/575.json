    "instruction": "Evaluate and communicate your portfolio\u2019s net societal impact and address any gaps you identify in terms of contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",
    "output": "Our institutional investors have stated a preference to see our portfolio's net external impact (positive minus negative) as a holistic picture that accounts for the 17 UN SDGs. We have used a systematic framework that considers both positive and negative impacts on products and services, as well as operational conduct. Through this analysis, we have identified gaps in our portfolio's alignment with the SDGs and are working to address them. Our goal is to reduce negative impact by shifting capital away from business activities, strategy and operational involvement not aligned with achieving the SDGs, increase positive impact by shifting capital towards companies that provide products and services that serve needs defined by the SDGs, and promote improvement by shifting capital toward companies that improve operations, develop long-term and forward-looking strategy, and report on progress. We believe that by aligning our portfolio with the SDGs, we can not only achieve our financial objectives, but also create collateral benefits for society and contribute to closing the annual funding gap of USD 2.5 trillion to achieve the SDG targets by 2030.",

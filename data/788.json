    "output": "Understood. I will make the necessary adjustments to our investment portfolio to reflect the changes in the MSCI GIMI Indexes. These changes were announced on May 12, 2020, and will be effective as of June 1, 2020, in accordance with the semi-annual index review (SAIR) methodology. During this SAIR, companies were reassessed against liquidity criteria and assigned to large-, mid-, and small-cap size segments. In addition, buffer zones were applied to reduce index turnover. With the recent shifts in equity markets, it is important that we refresh our portfolio to reflect these changes in the MSCI GIMI Indexes.",

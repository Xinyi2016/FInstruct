    "output": "Managing low-carbon transition risks is crucial for companies within the energy sector because it can have a significant impact on their financial performance. Companies that demonstrate a greater emphasis on the low-carbon transition (LCT) tend to outperform their sector peers who have weaker management of LCT risks. This highlights the importance of prioritizing and implementing strategies that prioritize the transition to a low-carbon economy. Failure to manage these risks can lead to underperformance in financial markets and may lead to reputational harm. Therefore, companies should prioritize strategies that prioritize the low-carbon transition to better manage their risks and ensure they remain competitive in the market.",

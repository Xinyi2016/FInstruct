    "output": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the infrastructure asset class, much like it has impacted other areas of the economy. Private infrastructure assets held up better than their listed counterparts, although risk levels remained elevated. Transport infrastructure, in particular, was affected by pandemic-enforced travel restrictions, leading to poor performance and a drop in the overall return of the MSCI Global Quarterly Private Infrastructure Index in the first half of 2020. However, infrastructure investments remain critical for economic growth and have significantly grown over the past decade, with over USD 403.3 billion raised by private-capital infrastructure funds since inception, according to data from the Burgiss Manager Universe. Despite the negative year-to-date performance of infrastructure investments, a closer look at investment types, subsectors, and risk levels may provide valuable perspective for private-capital firms and investors managing through the pandemic.",

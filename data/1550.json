    "instruction": "Please analyze the impact of inflation and rising interest rates on companies with low valuations according to the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes.",
    "output": "Our analysis of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes shows that companies with low valuations historically benefit from economic coupling with high inflation and rising interest rates. However, the rally in value stocks and quality drag were the primary detractors from the index's performance in 2022. Meanwhile, companies with strong fundamentals (quality) and low-idiosyncratic and systematic-risk showed higher allocations. Our analysis also indicates that higher ESG-rated companies produced higher returns after removing the effect of industries, countries, and other fundamental characteristics, even though the ESG factor had a lesser impact in 2022 compared to previous years. The MSCI ACWI ESG Focus Index was less impacted by the value outperformance and quality drag due to the aforementioned controls.",

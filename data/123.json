    "output": "In Cameroon, poverty is a pervasive issue that extends beyond just meeting basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter. It encompasses a range of challenges such as hunger, lack of shelter, inability to access medical care, unemployment, and fear for the future. In some rural areas, children are unable to attend school due to dire living conditions, which hinders their ability to read and write. The country's poverty line, set at 36000 FCFA (approximately US $65.5) per month, is insufficient to meet minimum consumption requirements for basic needs. As a result, a significant portion of the population lives in extreme poverty. The lack of motivation to study and serve in the country is partly attributed to unemployment, poverty, and low wages, which are often below the poverty line. This is particularly true for private primary and secondary school teachers, caretakers, and other low-income earners.",

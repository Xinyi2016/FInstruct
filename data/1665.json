    "output": "Institutional investors can implement ESG principles without sacrificing diversification or abandoning efforts to improve corporate conduct by increasing the weightings of companies with strong ESG profiles, including those that show improved ESG ratings over the most recent 12 months, while minimizing exclusions to a core group of objectionable stocks. This approach allows investment in a broad, diversified stock universe while still allowing engagement with poor ESG performers. The core set of excluded stocks should include only the worst ESG performers, as defined by their involvement in controversial weapons or violations of international human-rights and environmental norms. The use of the MSCI ESG Universal Index can produce superior ESG profiles with similar risk-return characteristics to the parent index, as backtested simulation from Nov. 30, 2009 to June 30, 2017, has shown. Overall, targeting companies with stronger ESG profiles than their peers can help institutional investors integrate ESG considerations into their investment strategy in a more systematic way.",

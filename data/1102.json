    "instruction": "Please discuss MSCI's role in helping companies capture opportunities for carbon reduction and identifying risks in low-carbon transformation, especially in light of Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcement on China's peak carbon emission before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060.",
    "output": "MSCI has accumulated many years of research experience in carbon emissions and has established relevant indices associated with it, such as the latest MSCI China A-Share Climate Change Index. This index can be compared to the mother index and shows a 66% decrease in carbon emissions intensity and a significant reduction in thermal coal reserves exposure. In addition, by taking into account climate change considerations, the index has been well optimized in terms of carbon footprint, and green income has significantly improved. After evaluating ESG for Chinese A-shares, MSCI noted an improvement in the market, with Chinese listed companies becoming increasingly aware of ESG and improving their information disclosure standards. It is believed that more institutions will be willing to practice ESG and promote China's green transformation through market-oriented means.",

    "output": "Upon analyzing the performance on Nov. 9 using equity risk models, it is revealed that the outperformance of small-cap stocks was driven by risky assets with higher beta and lower profitability compared to large caps. Additionally, there was a rotation out of momentum that contributed to this phenomenon. However, size-factor returns did not have any impact on the performance. It is important for investors to systematically analyze performance using risk-analytics tools to avoid jumping to intuitive but wrong conclusions.",

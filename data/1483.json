    "output": "Based on the three hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, it is recommended to adjust investment strategies accordingly. For the positive supply shock scenario, it may be beneficial to increase exposure to equity markets in the near term, as the expectation is for a rebound. For the soft landing scenario, it may be wise to slightly reduce equity exposure to prepare for a decline in returns. For the stagnant long-run growth scenario, it may be necessary to significantly reduce equity exposure and shift investments towards alternative asset classes, such as bonds or real estate, that may offer more stable returns. It is important to regularly review and adjust investment strategies based on changing macroeconomic conditions to optimize portfolio performance.",

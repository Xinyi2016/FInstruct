    "instruction": "Please analyze the active return contribution of each value descriptor for each sector and determine if they had a positive or negative impact.",
    "output": "After analyzing the data, we found that all three value descriptors contributed positively in a majority of sectors. Additionally, even within the energy sector, value delivered a positive contribution overall, but this was offset by sector-specific effects. Therefore, we can conclude that the value descriptors had a generally positive impact overall.",

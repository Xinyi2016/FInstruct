    "output": "To properly assess the potential of both listed and direct real estate for use in overall real estate portfolios, it is important to understand their performance drivers. Our research, conducted in association with the European Public Real Estate Association, compared market indexes and precisely matched samples from 19 European listed real estate companies with long-term returns at the asset level. \n\nOur findings showed that there are high correlations across asset, vehicle and security levels, particularly over longer periods, suggesting that listed real estate companies may be used as components of overall real estate portfolio strategies. We also found that asset-level returns are the main driver of overall equity performance in the long term, but vehicle/financial factors also influence returns, especially in phases of weak or strong overall equity returns. \n\nAdditionally, our analysis showed that index returns for asset, vehicle and equity levels are broadly synchronised over the longer term, but diverged in periods up to around 18 months. This indicates that overall cyclical patterns are largely matched between these levels, allowing for potential portfolio diversification between the different forms of real estate. However, it is important to conduct proper performance reconciliation and attribution analyses to ensure that the combination of these forms of real estate aligns with overall portfolio goals.",

    "output": "The inflation assumption and other drivers, such as increased investment demand, feed into the short- and long-term interest-rate projections in the NGFS scenarios. These projections are used to assess how much different countries' sovereign-bond yields could move if investors' expectations shifted from a climate-agnostic baseline scenario to alternative climate-transition scenarios. For the \"Net-Zero 2050\" scenario, most countries in the analysis experience a significant jump in the short end of the yield curve. If U.S. investors were to suddenly adjust their expectations from a climate-agnostic to the \"Net-Zero 2050\" scenario, we estimate that the yield curve could be shocked with upward spikes of approximately 85 basis points (bps) at the short end of the curve and 40 to 50 bps at the longer end. In contrast, for the \"Delayed Transition\" scenario, yields at the long end could increase more, consistent with the later timing of the inflation spike.",

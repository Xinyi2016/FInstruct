    "output": "Dragon Kings are extreme events that deviate strongly from the expected behavior of a power-law distribution. They are characterized by a sharp drop-off in the tail of the distribution, which is not captured by traditional power-law models. The GB distribution, on the other hand, is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution that allows for long power-law tails and a drop-off at a certain scale, making it well-suited for modeling Dragon Kings. By studying the relationship between Dragon Kings and the GB distribution, researchers can gain insights into the behavior of extreme events in various fields, including finance and economics.",

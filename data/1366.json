    "instruction": "Can you provide more information on the MSCI China Index's performance compared to the MSCI World Index and the MSCI China A Index?",
    "output": "Yes, between January 2021 and March 2022, the MSCI China Index, a combination of onshore and offshore stocks, underperformed the MSCI World Index by 49%. However, the MSCI China A Index, containing onshore stocks only, outperformed the MSCI China Index during the same period. The downturn in China's real estate market and crackdown on its tech sector may have contributed to this underperformance. Going forward, the new COVID-19 wave and lockdowns, the Russia-Ukraine war, and concerns about economic decoupling are seen as the most pressing issues.",

    "output": "The procedure for estimating the relaxation time in a mixing economy using the total variational distance involves the following steps:\n\n1. Define a relevant steady state distribution to which the rescaled transformation of wealth converges.\n2. Select a subsample of size K\ud835\udc3eKitalic_K consisting of the individuals that are closest to the mean wealth (i.e. the typical individuals in the economy).\n3. Track the subsample wealth distribution over time and quantify the difference between the subsample wealth distribution and the steady state distribution with the total variational distance.\n4. The total variational distance will exhibit two states: a relaxation time state during which the two distributions will converge towards each other, and the distance will decrease, and a stable state where the log of the distance reaches a plateau and fluctuates around this plateau. The magnitude of the plateau will be determined by the subsample size.\n5. In a mixing economy, the total variational distance will be small and exhibit statistical significance in the stable state. The point at which the plateau is reached will, in general, be higher than the relaxation time. Hence, one can use the time point at which the total variational distance becomes significant as an upper bound for the relaxation time and as a sign that the economy is mixing.",

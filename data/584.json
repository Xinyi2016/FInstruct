    "instruction": "How can institutional investors address the lower governance standards and lack of transparency in emerging-market companies, particularly those dominated by controlling shareholders and state-owned enterprises?",
    "output": "Institutional investors can address these issues by integrating ESG data and ratings, particularly focusing on governance issues, into their investment process. This may include assessing shareholder-manager alignment, voting rights, compensation incentives, and accuracy of financial statements. Identifying management quality within emerging markets through MSCI ESG Research's corporate governance scores can also help investors gain insight into how well a company's governance affects the interests of its minority investors. Ownership structure also matters in the context of governance characteristics, with controlled family firms tending to have lower overall corporate governance scores. However, family firms in China were considered relatively well-governed. Finally, active managers and indexes can use a reweighting approach, tilting towards firms with higher governance ratings while preserving their investment style and holdings.",

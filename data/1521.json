    "output": "As per your instruction, we have conducted a study on the correlation between board gender diversity and employee productivity in companies based in Asia. Our findings show that there is a positive correlation between the presence of female directors on boards and higher growth in employee productivity. We also found that countries like Malaysia, India, and Korea have introduced legislation to ensure better representation of women on boards. The requirement for independent female directors could also help improve talent-management practices. Companies with at least one female director had higher human-capital-management performance than those without any female directors. Our study suggests that having a diverse board can have a positive impact on the company's overall performance, including employee productivity.",

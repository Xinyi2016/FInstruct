    "output": "Holacracies and self-managing organizations are two concepts that have gained popularity in recent years as a response to the trend towards less hierarchical organizational forms. In holacracies, individuals can be members of multiple teams, hold multiple roles, and exercise leadership functions. This flexible design promotes individualization and responsiveness within the organization. On the other hand, self-managing organizations are characterized by decentralized decision-making authority, where every employee has a certain degree of decision-making authority and decisions cannot be overruled by others. Self-managing organizations are related to the concepts of boss-less organizations and self-organizing organizations, which allow employees to make both strategic and tactical decisions at all levels of the organization. These concepts belong to the class of evolutionary approaches to organizational design, which view organizational design as an emergent property rather than the result of intentional planning.",

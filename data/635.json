    "instruction": "Please explain whether growth's recent performance is an anomaly based on different growth strategies.",
    "output": "To answer this question, we need to consider different growth strategies. If we are talking about a simple strategy that selects high-growth stocks, then the recent performance is not representative of that strategy's long-term historical performance. The recent outperformance can be attributed to non-growth factors and particular sectors. On the other hand, for a factor- and sector-controlled growth strategy, the recent outperformance has been in line with the longer-term outperformance. In this case, the performance is mainly driven by exposure to the growth factor. So, whether growth's recent performance is an anomaly or not really depends on the growth strategy being used.",

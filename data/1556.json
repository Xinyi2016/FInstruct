    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of MSCI climate indices performance this year.",
    "output": "Various MSCI climate indices have been negatively impacted this year due to the rise in oil prices and the outperformance of the energy sector that follows. Typically, climate indices have a relatively low allocation to the energy sector. Other macroeconomic factors, such as high inflation, rising commodity prices, and interest rate hikes are also contributing to their negative performance. As we previously highlighted in a blog post, value stocks have been recovering, but climate indices have still faced headwinds. Nonetheless, the headwinds have been partially offset by green companies that have committed to long-term climate goals and outperformed in the first half of this year. MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index and MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index have both maintained low tracking errors due to their composition rules. While both indices have underperformed MSCI ACWI index this year, the extent of underperformance is smaller compared to MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index and MSCI ACWI Paris Aligned Climate Index. Therefore, this blog will focus on the latter two indices in the latter half.",

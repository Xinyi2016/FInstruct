    "output": "Based on our analysis of the impact of climate-related risks on a typical actively managed portfolio, we identified four simple exclusion strategies to mitigate these risks. Using new risk tools to measure these risks, we found that incorporating these exclusion strategies could meaningfully reduce a portfolio's exposure to both transition and physical climate risks without significantly affecting its risk/return profile. Thus, institutional investors could leverage these risk tools to properly manage the impact of climate risks on their portfolios and minimize potential losses.",

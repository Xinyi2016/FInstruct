    "output": "Time preference refers to the degree to which individuals or organizations value immediate gratification over long-term benefits. In the context of satellite launches, time preference plays a crucial role in determining the optimal number of satellites to launch. As the discount rate increases, the planner and open-access operators are likely to launch fewer satellites due to the increased cost of financing. At high discount rates, the planner may even prefer not to launch any satellites at all, as the potential for Kessler Syndrome and debris risks become more salient. This contrasts with biological resources like fisheries, where high discount rates may incentivize a profit-maximizing manager to drive a population to extinction. The difference lies in the fact that biological populations can reproduce without human investment, while artificial populations require upfront investment and generate profits over time. As a result, investing more today may reduce tomorrow's profits due to collisions and debris, but won't increase today's profits.",

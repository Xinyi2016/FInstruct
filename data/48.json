    "output": "The study finds that digital credit in Kenya has increased access to credit, reduced interest rates, and led to higher income and consumption. However, it also finds that digital credit has led to higher levels of debt and lower subjective well-being. The study also relates its findings to a larger literature on the welfare impacts of expanding credit access in low- and middle-income countries, and compares its results on subjective well-being to other studies.",

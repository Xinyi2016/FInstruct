    "instruction": "Analyze the exhibit below and explain the impact of the China theme on the three hypothetical portfolios represented by MSCI indexes.",
    "output": "Upon analyzing the exhibit, it can be observed that for broadly diversified indexes such as the MSCI World and MSCI EM ex China Indexes, the impact from the China theme is relatively smaller. This means that the returns from investing in these indexes are not heavily dependent on China's performance. However, the MSCI World with China Exposure Index shows a significantly larger China-specific return, indicating that China's performance has a significant impact on the returns of this particular index. Therefore, investors looking to benefit from China's growth potential may consider investing in the MSCI World with China Exposure Index to maximize their returns.",

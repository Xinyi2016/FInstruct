    "instruction": "Analyze the data presented and determine what needs to happen to bring shelter cost growth back to normal pace.",
    "output": "According to the data presented, shelter costs were weighted to represent 32.9% of the CPI in December of 2022 but represented 38.2% of the growth in the index from a year earlier. Earlier in 2022, shelter costs were well above their weight and represented much more growth than the weighting would suggest. To bring growth in shelter costs back to a normal pace, spot-market rent growth would need to fall to a 10.4% annual pace of decline by the fourth quarter of 2023, a significant decrease from the 12% year-over-year growth measured by the Cleveland Fed in midyear 2022. Alternatively, a more protracted slowdown to get back to average by the end of 2024 would need to see rent growth decline by 0.4% by year-end 2023 and stay flat through 2024.",

    "output": "In 2021, the oil and gas prices rebounded, but the diminishing weight of the industry's stocks had only a slight impact on the overall performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG index. Each industry had minimal influence on the index\u2019s ESG performance. Additionally, the active returns of each stock contributed the most to the MSCI ESG index in 2021. While the oil and gas industry experienced ongoing poor performance for the past five years, it rebounded in 2021. However, the MSCI ESG index displayed significant resilience despite the overall low weight of carbon-emitting industries, such as oil and gas. This post will discuss how both industry and stock selection contributed to the index's performance in 2021, despite significant changes in the market environment.",

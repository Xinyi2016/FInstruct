    "output": "Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by a central bank to control the supply of money and credit in an economy with the goal of achieving certain objectives. The primary objectives of monetary policy are to promote economic growth, maintain price stability, and reduce unemployment. Central banks use tools such as adjusting interest rates, reserve requirements for banks, and open market operations to influence the money supply and credit conditions in the economy. The tension between the Fed's objectives of being able to adjust monetary policy rapidly and maintaining a consistent and predictable policy highlights the challenges faced by policymakers in achieving these objectives.",

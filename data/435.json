    "output": "The study found that the energy consumption, the transfer of resources through international trade, the transition towards renewable energies, and environmental sustainability are key drivers in evaluating the resilience of energy systems. The study considered different types of embodied energy sources and the time evolution of sectors' and countries' interactions. The authors constructed a directed and weighted temporal multilayer network based on renewable and non-renewable sources, where sectors are nodes and layers are countries. They proposed a methodological approach for analyzing the network reliability and resilience and identified critical sectors and economies in the system using the Multi-Dimensional HITS algorithm. The authors also proposed a novel topological indicator based on the maximum flow problem to evaluate central arcs in the network at each time period. The study found that the methods were effective in catching different patterns between renewable and non-renewable energy sources. The study provides a full view of economies, sectors, and connections that play a relevant role over time in the network and whose removal could heavily affect the stability of the system.",

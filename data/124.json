    "output": "To implement the proposed solutions to overcome corruption and poverty in Cameroon, the following plan can be developed:\n\n1. Revision of the Electoral Code: The government should work with the ruling party and the first five opposition parties to agree on minimum requirements regarding the electoral code before the next presidential and parliamentary elections. This will ensure the independence of the electoral commission and avoid post-electoral crisis.\n2. Inclusion of Political Party Representatives: In each polling station, one or two representatives of every political party involved in the election should be present. This will ensure transparency and fairness in the voting process.\n3. Declaration of President and Vice-President: The president of the republic and the vice-president should be declared at the same time, with the president speaking French and the vice-president speaking English or vice-versa. This will ensure that both positions are filled simultaneously and avoid any confusion or disputes.\n4. Freedom of Declaration by the President of the Constitutional Court: The president of the constitutional court should be free to declare the president, vice-president, or members of national assembly. This will ensure that the declaration is based on the actual results of the election and not influenced by any political party.\n5. Citizen Participation in Budget Discussions: Citizens should be informed and involved in budget discussions ranging from the national assembly to the local councils. This will ensure transparency and accountability in the use of public funds and help reduce corruption.\n\nBy implementing these solutions, the government can effectively eradicate high-levels corruption and reduce poverty in Cameroon.",

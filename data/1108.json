    "instruction": "Please provide an explanation of how institutional investors typically manage market risk using derivative contracts such as futures and options.",
    "output": "Institutional investors often use derivative contracts such as futures and options to hedge against market risk or to express their investment views in certain market conditions. With the increased liquidity level of comprehensive multi-currency futures contracts based on MSCI Emerging Markets Index and MSCI China Index in recent years, some market participants have increased their usage of these contracts in asset allocation. Trading activity in futures based on MSCI Emerging Markets Index is even higher than that of spot trading in emerging market stocks. Institutional investors have also used derivative contracts in past market crises to manage market risk or express their market views.",

    "output": "In field markets, the distribution of information relevant to the pricing of securities is not observable or controllable, making it difficult to determine how the information reflected by prices relates to the information held by market participants. This poses a challenge in identifying whether the information reflected in prices is an average of information held by all participants or the amplification of superior information in the hands of a few traders.",

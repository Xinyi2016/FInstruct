    "output": "The economic outlook has shifted from optimism at the beginning of the year to realism, due to sticky inflation and turbulence in the banking industry. The International Monetary Fund has warned of a rising likelihood of a hard landing, and Fed Chair Jay Powell has suggested that tighter credit conditions following the banking turmoil could negatively impact economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The risk for policy mistakes is two-sided, with overtightening potentially leading to a recession, or not tightening enough and risking entrenched inflation. While bond-market-implied expectations are optimistic, a group of economists polled suggests that inflation may be stickier and that the Fed pivot may occur later than anticipated, at the start of 2024.",

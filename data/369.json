    "output": "Border enforcement has two primary effects on smuggling and trafficking organizations: a deterrence effect and a diversion effect. The deterrence effect discourages migrant crossings, while the diversion effect causes migrants to shift their crossings to other parts of the border. Despite the diversion effect, the overall volume of crossings can be relatively inelastic with respect to border enforcement. Empirical research has found a low impact of enforcement on overall crossing volumes, but substitution to other border sectors with higher crossing times and crossing risk and an increase the relative proportion of deaths from environmental factors such as dehydration.",

    "output": "Institution refers to the structure of multidimensional dependence in the spheres of economy, society, and politics. In the context of rural power relations and clientelism, the focus is on exploring whether dependence is concentrated on a few entities dominating over a good many households or whether it is distributed in a sufficiently diffuse manner. The emphasis is on such dependence at the local level, roughly at the level of a village and neighboring villages and towns.\n\nMeiksins Wood (2003) distinguishes between institutions by observing that only capitalism has a distinct economic sphere. This is due to the separation of economic power from political or military force and the force of the market, which imposes systemic requirements of competition, accumulation, and profit-maximization on everyone, including capitalists and workers. The distinctively capitalist separation of the economic and political has produced a more clearly defined and complete territorial sovereignty than was possible in non-capitalist societies.\n\nWhile the study does not seek to label institutions as 'capitalist' or 'semi-feudal', the pattern of dependence is used as an identifier of changing institutional dynamics. The concept of institution is crucial in understanding the distribution of power and resources in a given society and how it affects the lives of individuals and communities.",

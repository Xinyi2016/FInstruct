    "output": "The experiment in Figure 5 shows the average number of tasks exchanged when agents are allowed to reallocate tasks. The results indicate that task allocation is more dynamic when agents follow a performance-based strategy, as evidenced by the stabilization of the number of exchanged tasks at a value of 4444 after about 4444 periods of reallocation. In contrast, the interdependence-based strategy results in a lower number of exchanged tasks, which eventually converges to zero after approximately 7777 periods of reallocation. The results also suggest that the interdependence pattern, the incentive parameter, and the number of periods between task allocation do not or only marginally affect the average number of exchanged tasks. However, a slightly higher number of tasks are reallocated when agents have more time to learn about interdependencies.",

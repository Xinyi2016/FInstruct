    "output": "The methodology used in the study appears to be well-designed and appropriate for the research question at hand. The use of the True Freshman Survey data, which has a large sample size and is administered by a diverse set of institutions, is a strength of the study. Additionally, the use of zipcode information to map respondents to their home counties and link the data to the ACS is a clever solution to the limitation of the ACS only including degree field data starting in 2009. However, it would be useful to have more information on the specific calculations used to develop the proxy for local labor market skills and how the accuracy of this proxy was assessed. Overall, the methodology seems sound, but further detail and transparency about the calculations and assumptions would be beneficial.",

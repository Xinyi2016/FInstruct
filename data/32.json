    "output": "Figure 9 displays the speedup of the parallelized DDSG time iteration framework with respect to an SG version. The figure shows a single time iteration step of an 8888-dimensional model for DDSG at maximum expansion order 1111 and 2222 at varying refinement levels in the left panel. At refinement level 7777, for the respective tests, the DDSG approach provides 240240240240 and 10101010 times faster runtimes than the SG approach. In the right panel, the figure shows the time-to-solution for a single DDSG time iteration step at a maximum expansion order of 1111, maximum refinement level 3333, and varying dimensions for the smooth IRBC model. The DDSG routine provides a speedup of up to 10101010 times over SG implementation. The reason for this speedup is primarily due to DDSG operating on 100100100100 one-dimensional SGs while the SG time iteration framework operates on a 100100100100-dimensional SG.",

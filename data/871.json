    "instruction": "Can you provide an overview of the ARRC's recommended approach to LIBOR discontinuation and the transition to SOFR, and how it affects different financial instruments?",
    "output": "The ARRC has published its 2020 objectives and recommended best practices for addressing the discontinuation of LIBOR and transitioning to SOFR. This includes supporting SOFR use and liquidity, establishing market infrastructure and operations, implementing contractual fallbacks, and providing legal, tax, accounting, and regulatory clarity. For new contracts, the ARRC has finalized the recommended fallback language, which is similar to that used by ISDA for derivatives, with a broader \"waterfall\" of term and spread. The ARRC recommends a static spread adjustment that would reflect the historical median of the difference between LIBOR and SOFR over a five-year lookback period. The transition to SOFR affects various financial instruments, namely Agency adjustable-rate-mortgage (ARM) MBS, commercial MBS, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), ABS of floating loans, and leveraged loans. The GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made strides in the transition planning and endorsed the ARRC's recommended fallback language. The leveraged-loan market and CLO/CDO market have updated recommendations for fallback language and target for cessation of new issuances' use of USD LIBOR by June 30, 2021.",

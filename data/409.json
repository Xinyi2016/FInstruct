    "output": "Wind power is a crucial factor in reducing optimal storage needs through geographical balancing. Our analysis shows that wind power availability in neighboring countries during peak residual load hours of a given country is relatively high. This allows for better utilization of unevenly distributed wind generation potentials in an interconnected system, resulting in an 80% reduction in storage energy and discharging power capacity needs on average. The heterogeneity between countries accounts for this reduction. In contrast, differences in the profiles of solar PV and load, as well as in power plant portfolios (hydropower and bioenergy), contribute to the mitigation of storage needs to a much smaller extent. Our findings suggest that qualitatively similar results could be derived for other non-island countries in temperate climate zones where wind power plays an important role in the energy mix.",

    "output": "Deglobalization has had significant effects on how institutional investors construct their portfolios in listed assets. Return dispersion across national markets has reduced, and property type has become a more critical return driver, leading to stronger international alignment. However, real estate has become more global in recent years with cross-border transactions remaining stable, indicating increased investor interest in the asset class. Despite the challenges posed by deglobalization, historical preferences for transparent and stable markets may help mitigate some of these difficulties. Real estate investors have traditionally exhibited a strong home bias, with a preference for local markets. But when investing offshore, markets with higher levels of transparency, better governance, and stability have tended to attract more real estate capital.",

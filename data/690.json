    "instruction": "Please explain how the inclusion of China A shares affected the sector scope in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.",
    "output": "Prior to the inclusion of China A shares, the scope of sectors in EM was relatively narrow, with only around 40 stocks in sectors such as health care, real estate, and communications services. However, this greatly expanded in November 2019, with more than 60 standard constituent stocks in each of the 11 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae) sectors. The trading liquidity of EM index constituents also increased significantly with the inclusion of China A shares, particularly in the information technology and health care sectors.",

    "output": "According to recent studies, the impact of Covid-19 on innovation has been examined, but little attention has been paid to its direct impact on invention activities. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the full population of USPTO patent applications in a timeframe that covers a significant part of patents applications filed in the time period after the onset of the pandemic in early 2020. The study identifies Covid-19 relevant patents by performing keyword searches in the patent application fulltexts and finds that direct Covid-19 relevance has a strong, positive, and highly significant effect on the growth of patent applications during the first year of the pandemic, in contrast to an overall decline in patenting activity during that period. However, indirect Covid-19 relevant patents, which are derived from past CPC subclass to subclass citation patterns, are not particularly associated with the increase in the number of patent applications. Additionally, the study finds significant variation in the baseline growth of patent applications across different fields.",

    "output": "I have analyzed the crowding in our portfolio's \"bubbly\" stocks and found that there is a high level of concentration among a few large investors. This indicates a potential risk for these stocks if those investors were to sell off their positions. Additionally, the performance drivers of these stocks seem to be primarily driven by momentum and sentiment, rather than fundamental factors. Based on these findings, I recommend considering diversification and closely monitoring these stocks for any shifts in investor sentiment or market conditions.",

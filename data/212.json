    "output": "Incomplete preferences refer to situations where individuals are unable to compare or rank certain options, making it difficult for them to make decisions. In the context of market design, this concept challenges the assumption that agents have complete preferences, meaning they can compare any two options. The existence of incomplete preferences has been questioned in various contexts, including school choice applications.\n\nThe Indian Institute of Technology's (IIT) admission system provides an example of incomplete preferences. Each year, millions of students seek admission for about 34,000 engineering seats across IITs and non-IITs. The current procedure involves ranking students based on their performance on two exams. Thereafter, students submit their preferences, which are a strict, complete ordering over available choices. However, many students face a dilemma when making a choice between a more-preferred institute and a more-preferred discipline, as they may find certain options incomparable. This phenomenon highlights the existence of incomplete preferences in market design.",

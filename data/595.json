    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of factor strategies in Saudi Arabia and discuss the impact of controlling for exposure to small-cap companies.",
    "output": "Our analysis of the performance of factor strategies in Saudi Arabia showed that while the broader equity market significantly outperformed emerging markets, small-cap companies underperformed when compared to large- and mid-cap firms. This underperformance was a drag on the performance of some factor strategies in the country, contributing to a large dispersion in these strategies' returns.\n\nInvestors looking to employ a factor-based approach in Saudi Arabia would have benefited by controlling for exposure to small-cap companies. We found that the most significant underperformance came from the low-size factor, which underperformed the MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI by 11.7% from November 2016 to April 2019. One possible explanation for this underperformance is that as foreign investors started participating more in Saudi Arabia, their focus may have been more on the large, recognized companies rather than smaller firms.\n\nOur analysis also showed that investors who employed a factor-tilt approach that retained the full eligible universe in the index but tilted the constituent weights in proportion to their target factor exposure and market-cap weight may have helped investors harvest factor premia across other five factor indexes, including risk-weighted and quality. \n\nOverall, with the easing of foreign-ownership limits and other enhancements taken to improve market access, Saudi Arabia has provided more potential opportunities for foreign investors. However, investors incorporating factor strategies would have benefited from controlling exposure to Saudi small caps. As more investors gain experience in the region, we will continue to monitor both broad indexed exposure to market beta using MSCI IMI indexes and active allocations to factor strategies built on these broad indexes.",

    "instruction": "Evaluate the potential impact of implementing quarterly currency hedges on the annualized return of a portfolio consisting of local-currency indexes.",
    "output": "Based on the analysis of the MSCI Global Quarterly Property Fund Index, implementing quarterly currency hedges could significantly reduce return volatility to levels similar to local-currency indexes. However, due to the cost or benefit of hedging on a cumulative basis, there might be considerable differences in the annualized return between hedged, unhedged, and local-currency indexes. Therefore, it is important to carefully analyze the potential impact of such hedging strategies on the portfolio's overall return before implementing them.",

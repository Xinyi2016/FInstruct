    "output": "Arbitrage is a financial strategy that involves taking advantage of pricing inefficiencies in the market to generate risk-free profit. In the context of energy storage in electricity markets, arbitrage refers to the practice of storing energy when prices are low and selling it when prices are high, thereby generating revenue. This revenue source is important for energy storage in electricity markets because it helps to offset the costs of investing in storage technology. However, as more storage is added to the market, it can impact the energy price and reduce potential revenues, leading to strategic behaviors of profit-seeking storage investors.",

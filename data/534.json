    "output": "Deglobalization refers to the reversal of globalization, which is the process of increasing interdependence and interaction among the world's economies. Deglobalization may lead to a decrease in cross-border trade and investment, as well as a shift towards more regional trade flows. This could result in increased vulnerability to domestic economic conditions, but may also make national markets less vulnerable to external shocks. Institutional investors may choose to make country bets, in addition to being exposed to the diversified global equity universe, in order to reduce risk further.",

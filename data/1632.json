    "output": "The trend of sovereign green bond issuances has seen more issuers participate, with over 20 sovereign issuers joining since the first green bond was issued by Poland in 2016. Additionally, the issuance volume per issuer has increased, with some governments issuing green bonds on a semiregular basis. The public sector's role in green-bond issuances has also become increasingly important, with governments spearheading climate-transition projects. Moreover, some sovereign issuers have explored sustainability-linked-bond structures in recent quarters.",

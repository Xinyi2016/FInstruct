    "output": "After analyzing the daily changes to the illiquid bucket, we have identified a potential reason for extreme changes. It appears that sudden changes in market liquidity can cause fluctuations in the illiquid bucket, even with a smaller trade size. While this can cause a fund manager to exceed regulatory limits, it may not always be due to a sudden deterioration in market liquidity. Other factors, such as changes in investor sentiment or macroeconomic events, may also play a role in causing these extreme changes. It is important for fund managers to monitor the illiquid bucket closely and take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential risks.",

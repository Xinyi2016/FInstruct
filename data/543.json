    "output": "Climate change and biodiversity loss are interconnected and mutually exacerbating phenomena. Climate change can worsen the impacts of biodiversity loss, while biodiversity loss can exacerbate the effects of climate change. Forests, wetlands, and oceans play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change by absorbing an estimated 60% of annual global human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions. The loss of intact ecosystems such as forests and floodplains can increase the vulnerability of natural systems to the consequences of climate change, including flooding and soil erosion. In summary, the protection and restoration of biodiversity is essential for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change.",

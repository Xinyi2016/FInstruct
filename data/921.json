    "instruction": "Can you provide insights on the thematic tilts of growth funds of different sizes in relation to digital economy and next-gen internet?",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, funds with high assets under management (AUM) were relatively overweight in themes like digital economy, millennials, and next-gen internet. However, smaller growth funds more aggressively increased their exposure to the next-gen internet theme in the first half of 2020. Additionally, if we cut the fund universe by size-factor quartiles, we found that small-cap-tilted funds were more exposed to health-care tech and genomic innovation, and this trend continued to grow in 2020.",

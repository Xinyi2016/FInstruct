    "output": "To address the issue of regional divergences in climate stress test implementation, it is necessary to establish a common framework that all financial institutions can follow. The Network for Greening the Financial System can provide guidance and support in this regard. In addition, collaboration between Central Banks and supervisors can help to create a more comprehensive and harmonized system for climate scenario analysis.\n\nRegarding data gaps on value-chain emissions and climate targets of financial institutions\u2019 customers, it is essential to encourage transparency and disclosure from these institutions. This can be achieved through the establishment of reporting requirements, incentives for disclosure, and engagement with stakeholders. By improving data transparency, investors and supervisors can better understand the climate risk exposures of individual institutions and make more informed decisions.",

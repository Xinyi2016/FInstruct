    "output": "According to recent findings, companies exposed to physical climate risks are likely to experience revenue losses and asset damage in the coming decades. In fact, if we continue to rely on fossil fuels, nearly a quarter of the market value of companies in the MSCI ACWI IMI could be at risk of severe climate impacts. However, there is hope. If we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work towards keeping global warming to 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 as outlined in the Paris Agreement and various net zero initiatives \u2013 it's possible to decrease physical climate risks by an average of two-thirds for the constituents of MSCI ACWI IMI. This suggests that taking action to mitigate climate change is not only necessary for the health of our planet, but also for the long-term success of businesses worldwide.",

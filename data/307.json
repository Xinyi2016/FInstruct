    "output": "Endogenous expectations refer to expectations that are formed within the system, as opposed to being imposed from outside. When endogenous expectations are introduced, they react to variations in capital by favouring certain patterns over others. Highly reactive expectations favour pattern 3, which involves expected returns magnifying capital accumulation at the expense of other patterns. Mildly reactive expectations favour patterns 1 and 2, which experience oscillations that are dampened by uncertainties. Type-3 sectors, on the other hand, experience strong fluctuations in capital, and attracting capital is less effective with fading expectations. The threshold in capital accumulation shifts upwards, and least-profitable firms are ousted out of the sector. The recent evolution in performances between value and growth investment strategies exemplifies these shifts in investors' sentiment between expected growth and real returns.",

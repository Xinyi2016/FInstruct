    "output": "The study found that cash windfalls, such as winning a lottery prize, can positively impact entrepreneurial entry. The study also found that the impact of a cash windfall is more pronounced for households who are liquidity-constrained, such as less wealthy households and those winning lottery prizes during the recession period. The study also examined whether the positive wealth effect flattens out after the constraints cease to bind, by breaking down lottery prize amounts into different intervals. The results suggest that the positive effect of winning a lottery prize on business entry stops increasing when the winning amount surpasses the 30 million NT$ threshold, which corresponds to the average capital requirement for incorporated companies in Taiwan. The study also found that households establish new businesses in high-capital industries or incorporated companies only when receiving a cash windfall of more than 30 million NT$. These findings suggest that the presence of liquidity constraints could be a crucial barrier to creating businesses that require a certain amount of capital. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between cash windfalls and entrepreneurial entry by showing that cash windfalls can positively impact entrepreneurial entry, but that the impact is more pronounced for households who are liquidity-constrained.",

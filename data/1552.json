    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of how the MSCI ACWI climate-related indices have performed compared to the ACWI index, and what factors have influenced their performance.",
    "output": "According to the information provided, the various MSCI ACWI climate-related indices underperformed the ACWI index in the first half of 2022, but outperformed it from November 29, 2013 to December 31, 2021. The main reasons for underperformance this year were the outperformance of the energy sector and the recovery of value stocks, but green revenue companies contributed to the index. The MSCI climate indices incorporate goals related to climate change and the Paris Agreement, and have consistently achieved strong results in both climate change mitigation and goal achievement. From November 29, 2013 to December 31, 2021, the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index and the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index moved in line with the ACWI Index, but the ACWI Climate Change Index and the MSCI Climate Paris Agreement Aligned Index outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index by around 125 basis points (bps) per year (see table below). Both indices incorporate climate goals, but their approaches are significantly different. This difference is reflected in diverse active shares and tracking errors, and may play an important role in the selection process for institutional investors to construct investment products according to their investment objectives.",

    "output": "The decrease in liquidity in Compound\u2019s ETH market is likely due to a combination of factors. One reason is that lenders may fear an increase in utilization, which can lead to liquidity risk. When utilization levels are high, lenders may not be able to withdraw their funds, which can decrease liquidity. Additionally, lenders may also wish to receive ETHW on the forked chain, which can further decrease liquidity. Furthermore, ahead of the merge, the official ETHW Twitter account recommended that funds be withdrawn from multiple DeFi pools, including Compound\u2019s ETH market, in order to ensure that lenders would receive ETHW. There was also talk about freezing DeFi contracts on the ETHW fork, which may have led to further decreases in liquidity. Despite these decreases, the market\u2019s liquidity remained significantly larger than the protocol\u2019s debt, which reached the borrowing cap of 100\u2019000 ahead of the merge.",

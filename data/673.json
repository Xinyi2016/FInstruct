    "output": "In recent years, real estate investors have been seeking out broad, geographic diversification and moving beyond their domestic borders. This has led to a growth in pan-regional property funds, which have become a significant part of the European market. While much of Europe has diversity in real estate markets that mirrors that of the U.S., there are added complexities due to varying legal and tax regimes, currencies, and property-market norms. Despite these complexities, individual assets have tended to be the main drivers of performance for these funds. In North America, there is significant overlap between property funds' national and regional exposure, but the large number and variety of major cities have provided a reasonable level of diversity in these funds' historical exposures. Asset managers have responded to this trend by developing pan-regional property funds to meet the demand for geographic diversification from real estate investors.",

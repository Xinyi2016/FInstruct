    "instruction": "Please provide an analysis of the impact of ESG factors on stock valuations and identify any asset characteristics that may help companies stay resilient in a changing macroeconomic environment.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that while oil and gas stock valuations did not have a significant impact on the performance of ESG Indexes, stock-specific returns and style factors that incorporate ESG considerations were the main drivers of performance. Additionally, we believe that companies with strong balance sheets and diversified revenue streams are better positioned to weather economic fluctuations. Other characteristics such as operational efficiency and technological innovation can also contribute to a company's resilience in a changing macroeconomic environment. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these factors and stock performance.",

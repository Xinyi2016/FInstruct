    "output": "Home bias in investment portfolios can lead to higher volatility and lower returns, particularly if the investor's home market is hit by negative events such as political upheavals or natural disasters. For example, uncertainty over Brexit has contributed to a decline in the MSCI United Kingdom Index, leading to weaker domestic stock-market performance and wiping out any capital appreciation since the start of the century. Investors with heavy exposure to their domestic market may be more vulnerable to this type of risk.\n\nTo reduce risk exposure and enhance returns, investors should consider diversifying their portfolios more internationally. This may help to offset the impact of any negative events in their home market and take advantage of global equities that offer good liquidity and accessibility. Historical data suggests that greater international diversification could have helped reduce risk exposure in UK investment portfolios tilted towards domestic stocks, over both the short and long term.\n\nFurthermore, home bias can also lead to significant sector and factor bets compared to a broader international equity index such as the MSCI ACWI IMI. For example, the UK market provides very little exposure to information technology and overweights energy and consumer staples, leading to a sizable overweight toward low-volatility stocks.\n\nInstitutional investors who venture out of their domestic market and capture the opportunities offered by global equities may benefit from significant risk reduction and return enhancement. Over the past 15 years, a GBP investor in the UK market would have benefited by investing in other developed markets, emerging markets, and small caps. Several large and leading UK pension plans have already adopted a more global approach in their equity asset allocation, breaking the regional and domestic/international divide. Other UK investors may choose to similarly rethink their equity investment process.",

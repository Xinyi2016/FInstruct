    "output": "The pandemic has led to lockdowns and social distancing measures that have reduced retail foot traffic and forced many retailers into bankruptcy. Additionally, the shift to remote work has resulted in many employees leaving the office, which may prompt businesses to reassess their space needs. This in turn may affect employees' residential decisions, potentially altering the types of housing they choose to live in. Owners of real estate will need to work harder to provide compelling offers to their tenants, which could impact their cash flows and the fundamental characteristics of the asset class.",

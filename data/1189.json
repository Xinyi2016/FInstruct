    "output": "Based on the analysis of U.K. data, it is clear that traditional property type and geography segmentations do not fully explain asset-level total-return variation. To improve portfolio management, it is recommended to incorporate real estate factors as a tool. Factors such as location, size, quality, condition, and tenant characteristics can help investors better understand the drivers of real estate performance. In order to develop a strategy, investors should first identify which factors are most relevant to their portfolio and invest in a data-driven analysis tool that can track and measure these factors over time. Next, investors should adjust their portfolio allocations and construction based on the insights gleaned from the real estate factors analysis. Finally, investors should monitor the performance of their portfolio over time to assess the impact of the factors on total-return variation. By incorporating real estate factors into their portfolio management approach, investors can achieve a more systematic investment strategy and better manage risk.",

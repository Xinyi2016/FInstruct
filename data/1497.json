    "output": "Thank you for providing the screening metrics. I have reviewed them and identified a few companies in our portfolio that are flagged for potential deforestation risks. I will now conduct a more in-depth review of their risk-management practices to ensure that we are making informed investment decisions and are taking proactive steps to address these risks. Additionally, I plan to engage with these companies on their policies, supply chain/commodity certification and monitoring or stringent targets to better understand how well-positioned they are to address deforestation risks compared to their peers without such measures.",

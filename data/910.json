    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of the factors on Nov. 9 and identify which had the largest absolute returns and which had the smallest.",
    "output": "Based on the exhibit provided, it is clear that beta and momentum factors had the largest absolute returns on Nov. 9. On the other hand, the size factor had the smallest absolute return, with a return very close to 0. This suggests that investors who were exposed to beta and momentum factors on that day may have experienced higher returns compared to those who were exposed to the size factor.",

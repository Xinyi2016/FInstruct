    "output": "Modular design is a design approach that breaks down a product into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, produced, and maintained independently of each other. This approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in product development and can reduce the need for coordination between different parts of the product. Modular design can be applied at different levels, including the level of functional components and the interfaces between modules. The concept of modular design has been explored in various fields, including product design, organizational design, and information systems.",

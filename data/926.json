    "output": "Based on the analysis of historical relationships between factor returns and macro cycles, we recommend an overweight exposure to low size and value factors for 2021. Our adaptive multi-factor model points towards this bias, as well as an underweight exposure to quality and low volatility and a neutral exposure to momentum and yield. We believe that a recovery in economic indicators will continue to be positive for low size and value exposures in the coming year.",

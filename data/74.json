    "output": "Mixing is a concept from statistical physics that measures the ability of individuals to move across the whole wealth distribution. It is used to quantify the degree of mixing in the wealth distribution, which is related to the feasibility of individuals to change their wealth ranking. In the context of economic mobility, mixing is inherently connected to the concept of mobility, as it measures the extent to which individuals can move across the whole distribution. The relaxation time, a statistical measure for the degree of mixing, is used to study the relationship between mixing and mobility in reallocating geometric Brownian motion (RGBM) models. The results show that measures of mixing are directly equivalent to the magnitude of standard measures of economic mobility, but the opposite is not true. Therefore, measuring mobility using standard measures in a non-mixing system may lead to misleading conclusions about the extent of mobility across the whole distribution.",

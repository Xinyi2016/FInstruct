    "output": "Based on current market conditions, there is a significant risk associated with investing in BBB-rated credit. The demand for yield among investment grade buyers has driven the outstanding amount of BBB paper to historic highs, which has led to a convergence of risk between BBB and BB credit. Additionally, if spreads were to widen, there is a potential for a wave of BBB credits to cascade into the high-yield market. According to MSCI's CreditManager, there is a 4% probability of a BBB credit being downgraded to BB, which could change the composition of the high-yield market by roughly 20% on a market-value basis. Furthermore, the market is currently compensating investors for taking duration risk, but if high-yield spreads are forced to extend duration across all credit as long-duration paper is forced off IG books, the market could react negatively. It is important for investors to strategize for such remote scenarios to minimize risk.",

    "instruction": "As a financial advisor, advise your clients on how they should prepare for potential physical-climate risks such as exposure to coastal flooding.",
    "output": "It is essential to take physical-climate risks such as exposure to coastal flooding seriously and plan accordingly. Investors should scrutinize which companies have more comprehensive insurance coverage and those that have put in place other risk-mitigation measures. Additionally, institutional investors should review their options on how they work to protect their portfolios from physical-climate risks, such as engaging with companies on physical-climate risk, reducing their exposure within a sector and/or a portfolio, or creating climate-smart benchmarks. Ignoring potential risks is not an option. We need to take the necessary steps to protect our investments and prepare for the unpredictable.",

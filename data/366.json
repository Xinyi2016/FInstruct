    "output": "Smugglers adapt to changes in interception rates by using smaller boats that can evade detection and increase their chances of reaching European search and rescue zones. This strategy also allows them to collect more revenue by adding more passengers. Despite this shift in strategy, the risk of death for passengers remains unchanged. However, there is a possibility that an increasing number of boats are sinking without being detected, leading to an underestimation of casualty rates.",

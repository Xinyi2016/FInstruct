    "output": "Based on the disclosed company business lines and corporate activity captured in business-description information, we have identified that your growth fund has a high thematic exposure to next-generation internet, digital economy, millennials, and disruptive technologies. Our analysis shows that these themes have a clear impact on the performance of the fund, with a much wider spread between the best- and worst-performing funds in this category for the first half of 2020 compared to 2019. We have also split the fund universe into high- and low-performance quartiles and have quantified the highly differentiated thematic positioning between the two. Overall, our report suggests that thematic \"beta\" has been a key performance driver for your growth fund.",

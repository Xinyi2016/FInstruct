    "output": "Uncertainty refers to the lack of information or knowledge about a particular situation or event. In the context of cognitive psychology, uncertainty increases individual propensity to rely on round numbers. This means that when individuals are uncertain about a particular quantity or value, they are more likely to use round numbers to estimate or represent that value. This phenomenon has been observed in various experiments, including those conducted by Ruud et al. (2014) and Converse and Dennis (2018). The reason for this is that when uncertainty increases, it becomes more costly for individuals to generate a more precise estimate, as they would have to scan a wider range of possible values. As a result, individuals tend to rely on round numbers, which are easier and faster to process.",

    "instruction": "Please explain how industry exposures and risk indexes have contributed to the long-term outperformance of these indexes.",
    "output": "Industry exposures have been a significant contributor to the outperformance of these indexes over the longer-term. This is because sector allocations were made based on historical analysis and expert judgment, which helped to identify the most promising industries and stocks within those sectors. On the other hand, the contribution from risk indexes was smaller, but still positive. This is because the indexes were designed to minimize exposure to certain types of market risk, such as interest rate risk and credit risk. Overall, both industry exposures and risk indexes have played an important role in the consistent and positive performance of these indexes over time.",

    "output": "Uncertainty refers to the lack of information or knowledge about a particular situation or outcome, which can lead to hesitation or indecision in decision-making. In the context of education, students may experience uncertainty about their future earnings and the risks associated with different career paths. This uncertainty can cause students to be risk-averse, which may influence their major choice and other educational decisions. The source of uncertainty can come from various sources, such as the returns to ability or the cost of acquiring skills, but ultimately, it affects the decision-making process. The model presented here simplifies the general form of uncertainty to focus on wages, but it is also applicable to other interpretations. The learning channel and some reduced form evidence are discussed in more detail in Appendix Section A.",

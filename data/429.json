    "output": "One possible method to estimate the exposure of stock to consumption growth while addressing the limitations of the traditional approach is to use a high-frequency regression framework. This framework would allow for a more precise measurement of market expectations by using investors' surveys as a proxy for expectations. Additionally, this framework would enable the estimation of exposures at a higher frequency, such as daily or intraday, which would provide more granular information about the relationship between stock returns and consumption growth. To implement this method, we would need to collect data on investors' forecasts made during the last days of the month t-1 for macroeconomic variables in month t. This data could then be used to estimate the exposure of stock to consumption growth in a way that controls for market expectations.",

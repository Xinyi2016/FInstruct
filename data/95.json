    "output": "The relative structure of party networks determines whether growing polarization between parties aids the interest group. Specifically, the marginal impact of increasing polarization (ideological or affective) between the parties on the interest group depends on the relative Bonacich-cohesiveness of the two parties. Bonacich-cohesiveness refers to the sum of Bonacich centralities of all its legislators. In other words, the more connected the legislators of a party are, the more Bonacich-cohesive that party is.\n\nThe study finds that an increase in ideological polarization between parties benefits the interest group if and only if the party in favor of the interest group is relatively more Bonacich-cohesive. Similarly, an increase in affective polarization increases the marginal returns from increasing ideological polarization if and only if the party in favor of the interest group is relatively more Bonacich-cohesive. However, the significance of relative cohesiveness of party networks vanishes if there is no ideological polarization.\n\nIn summary, the study shows that the structure of party networks plays a crucial role in determining the impact of polarization on interest groups. The relative Bonacich-cohesiveness of the two parties determines whether growing polarization between parties aids the interest group.",

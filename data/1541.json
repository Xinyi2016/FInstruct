    "output": "Based on our observations, it appears that quarterly earnings reports have a significant impact on the traded volumes and illiquid holdings of funds. When these reports are published, there is usually a collective spike in traded volumes for many stocks, which causes a sudden drop in the share of illiquid holdings across funds. Even when the markets remained calm, this phenomenon often occurred. However, when the volume spikes phased out of the averaging window, the illiquid fraction tended to jump again. This suggests that quarterly earnings reports can have a strong influence on the liquidity and trading behavior of funds, and may be an important factor to consider when analyzing investment strategies.",

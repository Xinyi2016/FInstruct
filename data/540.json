    "output": "The exhibit shows the estimated impact of yield shocks on the value of sovereign-bond portfolios for select countries. The yield shocks are based on different climate policy scenarios, including the \"Net-Zero 2050\" scenario and the \"Delayed Transition\" scenario. The exhibit indicates that the \"Net-Zero 2050\" scenario leads to the largest instantaneous repricing, with a 4% loss for the U.S. sovereign-bond portfolio. On the other hand, the U.K. sovereign-bond portfolio, which has an average duration of 13 years, contains more longer-dated bonds, which are more significantly impacted under the \"Delayed Transition\" scenario. As a result, the largest losses were experienced under that latter scenario.\n\nIn summary, the exhibit highlights the potential impact of climate policy scenarios on sovereign-bond portfolios and the importance of considering climate-related risks when making investment decisions. The exhibit also suggests that the impact of climate policies on sovereign-bond portfolios may vary depending on the duration of the bonds and the specific climate policy scenario.",

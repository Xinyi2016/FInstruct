    "instruction": "Please describe your company's current ESG rating and how it has changed over the past two years since the inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.",
    "output": "Our company's ESG rating has shown significant improvement since the inclusion of A-shares in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in 2018. At that time, ESG was a relatively new concept for most local investors and listed companies, and disclosure levels were still low. Many Chinese A-share companies were rated CCC or B. However, over the past two years, with the guidance of regulatory agencies and the push from domestic and foreign investors, ESG awareness and disclosure levels among domestic listed companies have increased continuously, leading to improved rating results. Some Chinese companies have exhibited strong ESG rating momentum, and the number of companies rated CCC has been decreasing.",

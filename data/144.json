    "output": "The study finds that the investment behavior of RJVs and mergers is identical when they both spend the entire joint budget but do not use external funds. However, the RJV is superior to the merger from a welfare perspective as it maintains competition without reducing the probability of innovation. This suggests that even mergers that lead to a higher innovation probability than R&D competition should be prohibited, as an RJV would have the same social benefits without the social costs of eliminating competition. The study highlights the importance of considering the impact of mergers on innovation and competition, and the need for competition authorities to carefully evaluate the necessity of mergers to achieve efficiency gains.",

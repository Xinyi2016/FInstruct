    "output": "Behavioral scientists are still biased even after gaining experience due to various factors such as \"What you see is all there is,\" selection bias, selective exposure, and motivated reasoning. These cognitive biases can influence the way behavioral scientists process information and make decisions, leading to inaccuracies in their assessments. While experience can mitigate bias to some extent, it may not be enough to eliminate it entirely. The forces of cognitive biases may continue to influence the behavioral scientists' perceptions and decisions, leading to persistent biases in their work.",

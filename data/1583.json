    "instruction": "Please explain the potential consequences of a default by the U.S. government and how the CDS market can be useful for investors in this situation.",
    "output": "A default by the U.S. government could result in major market dislocation and a sharp slowdown in economic activity. It could also impact holders of Treasurys. In this situation, the CDS market can be useful for investors. They can assess the overall market's view of the likelihood of a U.S.-government default, which can help them make informed investment decisions. As the summer approaches and the U.S. government fails to reach a legislative agreement, CDS trading volume may continue to increase, indicating investor concern about the possibility of missing payments on U.S. Treasurys looms larger.",

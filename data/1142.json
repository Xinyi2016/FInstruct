    "instruction": "Use historical trends and the analysis of CSV to make more informed decisions as an active manager in risk budgeting, style factors, industries, countries, and stock selection in your global-equity portfolios.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, it is clear that dispersion in markets has historically provided opportunities for active managers to outperform their respective benchmarks. Using the CSV, we can identify where the dispersion is greatest and make informed decisions on risk budgeting among style factors, industries, and countries, as well as for stock selection in our global-equity portfolios. Despite falling market volatility, declines in stock correlations have kept CSV elevated, with style factors playing an increasing role in driving CSV relative to industries and countries in both developed and emerging markets. It is important to note that stock-specific contribution to overall CSV has been on the rise, particularly in emerging markets. By staying on top of these trends in dispersion, we can make more informed decisions as active managers and aim to outperform our benchmarks.",

    "output": "After reviewing the historical averages of financial indicators related to the three transmission channels for the five ESG rating groups presented, we found that Q5, which represents the companies with the highest MSCI ESG rating, generally performs better in all three channels in the Chinese stock market. \n\nIn the cash flow channel, Q5 companies, which have higher ESG ratings, are better at managing intangible capital such as employees, and can generate higher profits over time. In the specific risk channel, Q5 companies, with strong risk management skills, are less likely to encounter unexpected costs due to accidents. In the valuation channel, Q5 companies, which are more efficient at utilizing resources, are less susceptible to market shocks such as fluctuations in energy prices. \n\nOverall, Q5 companies have lower systemic risks, resulting in lower financing costs and higher valuations in the discounted cash flow framework. This is in line with previous research on developed market stocks. Therefore, it can be concluded that companies with higher ESG ratings generally perform better in managing financial risks and generating returns in both developed and emerging markets.",

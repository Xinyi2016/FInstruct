    "output": "Industries with positive fixed costs play a significant role in the mechanism as they consist mostly of monopolies and duopolies. The average number of firms in these industries is relatively low, ranging from 1.47 to 1.97 across the three calibrated economies. This implies a relatively high markup, with an average of 1.75 in 1975, 2.32 in 1990, and 2.59 in 2007. These values are within the bounds of estimates for the markup distribution of US firms. Concentrated industries represent a significant portion of aggregate employment, approximately 6.8% in the 2007 model. The authors regard these numbers as reasonable given the disaggregated nature of markets in the model and the presence of monopolies and duopolies in the right tail of the empirical markup distribution.",

    "instruction": "Write a report evaluating the climate-target disclosures of a particular company and provide recommendations on how they can improve their disclosure frameworks.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis of climate-target disclosures across various companies, it is clear that there is a lack of consistency and comparability in reporting. This makes it difficult for investors and stakeholders to accurately assess the actual reduction in tons of CO2 equivalent and the potential impact on companies' carbon-risk profiles. \n\nIn evaluating your company's climate-target disclosures, we found that there was no clear starting point or baseline year for emissions, which can make it difficult to track progress towards targets. Additionally, some target metrics focused on emission intensities per economic unit while others focused on absolute emissions reduction. \n\nTo improve your disclosure framework, we recommend standardizing your reporting to include a clear starting point for emissions, as well as consistent metrics for measuring progress towards targets. This could include reporting both absolute emissions reduction and emission intensity per economic unit. \n\nFurthermore, it may be helpful to provide context around your targets by comparing them to industry-wide benchmarks or outlining how they align with global climate goals. This would make it easier for investors and stakeholders to assess the potential impact of your targets on your carbon-risk profile. \n\nOverall, we believe that improving your climate-target disclosures will not only benefit your company's sustainability efforts but will also provide greater transparency for investors and stakeholders.",

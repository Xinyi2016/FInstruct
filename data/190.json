    "output": "Transactive control is a feedback loop resulting from incentives provided to consumers to ensure that the underlying resources are optimally utilized. It was introduced in the context of smart grids and consists of an incentive signal sent to the consumer from the infrastructure and a feedback signal received from the consumer. Transactive control has been applied in smart grids and transportation systems to regulate traffic density and alleviate congestion through dynamic toll pricing. The concept of transactive control is based on the idea that consumers can be empowered to serve as actuators into an infrastructure, and the goal is to ensure that the goals of the infrastructure are realized. The use of transactive control in smart grids can be traced to homeostatic control proposed in (Schweppe, 1978) and (Schweppe et al., 1980), which suggested that demand-side assets can be engaged using economic signals. Transactive control in this context has come to denote market-based control mechanisms that incentivize responsive loads and engage them in providing services to the grid where and when of great need.",

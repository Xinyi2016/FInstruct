    "output": "According to a recent report, the events that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) resulted in a fall in markets across the globe and raised questions about the health and risk management of banks and other financial institutions. The report looked at the impact of the collapse on the banking industry through the lens of MSCI Factor Lab\u2019s news-sentiment score. The scores of U.S. bank stocks were hit worse than their European counterparts, and the decline in the relative news-sentiment score of regional banks was greater than that of diversified banks. Interestingly, the news-sentiment score of U.S. asset management and custody banks also experienced a big decline, showing that negative sentiment was not limited to banking stocks, but was widespread across financial institutions in the U.S.",

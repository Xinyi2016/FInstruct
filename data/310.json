    "output": "Systems of innovation refer to the network of private and public institutions operating within a territory that interact to discover and spread new technologies. The concept has its roots in evolutionary economics and has been adapted over time to serve as a framework to describe and analyze national and regional innovation systems. The triple helix model is a similar perspective that identifies economic agents and their co-evolution as drivers of knowledge production and innovation in knowledge-based societies. Understanding the evolution of different layers in the global set of national economic systems has become increasingly relevant in the economic literature, and various empirical tools have been proposed to address it.",

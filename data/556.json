    "output": "The risks of not hedging currency risk in emerging markets equity portfolios have become more significant in recent years due to increasing currency volatility. While currencies of emerging markets can provide a tailwind to equity performance, their poor fundamentals and geopolitical risks can impact the value of the portfolio. Furthermore, the cost of hedging these currencies has been a deterrent for investors.\n\nHowever, using a dynamic or adaptive hedging approach that incorporates the currency volatility factor may help investors mitigate these risks. By observing when short-term average volatility exceeds long-term average volatility, investors can decide when to hedge currency exposure. Additionally, taking a broad view on currency hedging for emerging-market currencies in aggregate using the MSCI EM Currency Index as a proxy for currency risk exposure may also be beneficial. \n\nOverall, investors should weigh the risks and benefits of not hedging currency risk and consider implementing a dynamic hedging approach with the help of a financial expert.",

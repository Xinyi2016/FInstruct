    "output": "The average cross-sectional correlation of COVID-19 factors between the two methods used is 0.73, which suggests that there is a relatively strong positive relationship between the two methods in terms of their exposure to COVID-19 factors. However, we should note that the correlation between the two sets of weights is lower at 0.67, indicating that there may be some differences in how the methods are weighting individual stocks.",

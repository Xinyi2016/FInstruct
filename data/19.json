    "output": "The Stochastic LQ control method is a powerful tool for solving mean-variance problems with trading constraints and random coefficients. It has been applied in several papers. However, it is less effective when dealing with mean-variance problems with state constraints such as bankruptcy prohibition. In such cases, other methods such as martingale approach or partial differential equation (PDE) method are often used. The martingale approach requires the market to be complete, while the PDE method requires a Markovian market setting. Despite its limitations, the Stochastic LQ control method has been used to solve a variety of mean-variance problems, including those with both trading and bankruptcy prohibition constraints.",

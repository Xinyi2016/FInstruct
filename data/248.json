    "instruction": "Analyze the ETHW price leading up to and post-merge.",
    "output": "We observe that the price movements of ETHW were more pronounced than those of ETH. Additionally, the value of ETHW was around 3% that of ETH at the time the merge was executed. Lending protocols feared that users would take out ETH loans right before the merge to profit from the fork, leading them to intervene and disincentivize such behavior.",

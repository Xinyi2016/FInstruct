    "output": "The authors restricted their analysis to incidents involving rubber boats for two primary reasons. First, rubber boats tend to have a more uniform physical size, which means that the number of people is a reasonable proxy for crowding. This is not the case for wooden boats, which may vary dramatically in their capacity. Second, while rubber boats can be imported cheaply, the supply of large wooden boats in the region has become increasingly scarce over time as these boats have sunk or been destroyed by anti-smuggling operations. Therefore, the choice of how many people to place on board a wooden boat may be exogenously affected by the scarcity of large ships. By restricting their analysis to rubber boats, the authors preserved the majority of incidents in the Frontex dataset: 74% of incidents originating in Libya involve rubber boats, relative to just 14% of incidents which involve wooden boats. Further details on the distribution of boat sizes and the relationship between boat size and quarterly interception probabilities are discussed in Appendix D.2.",

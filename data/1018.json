    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the findings from the comparison of long-horizon multiperiod stress tests on different allocations to U.S. equities and bonds.",
    "output": "The analysis found that, even in scenarios with the largest initial one-year drawdown for a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, the portfolio return was positive over a five-year horizon. Short-term drawdown risk is important, but it does not take market recoveries into account and may result in overly conservative allocations for long-horizon investors. Long-horizon investors might aim to ride out short-term disruptions in the market, and shorter-term risk measures may therefore be less appropriate for their investment horizons. The analysis looked at the one- and five-year return distributions of hypothetical portfolios of different allocations to U.S. bonds and equities using 50 years of history, and found that although the average annualized returns were nearly identical over the different horizons, the distribution was significantly wider for one-year scenarios because markets typically recovered within a five-year period. Imposing a risk budget on measures calibrated over a shorter horizon might have resulted in excessively conservative allocations that missed out on gains during market rebounds.",

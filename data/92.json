    "output": "The study found that more concentrated industries experienced lower employment growth in the aftermath of the great recession. The results showed that a 1pp higher pre-crisis concentration is associated with a 2pp lower employment growth rate between 2007 and 2016. The study also found that a similar pattern is found if the total wage bill is used instead. The study also found that a 1pp increase in the concentration measure is associated with a 2-3pp decrease in the post-crisis net entry.",

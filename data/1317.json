    "output": "To understand the performance diversity across and within industrial properties in the US market in 2021, \"distribution slicing\" methodology can be used. This approach involves breaking down the returns into different segments based on various factors such as location, tenant mix, lease expiration, property size, and so on. By analyzing the data at a more granular level, it is possible to identify the drivers of increased performance diversity across individual assets within the industrial sector. For instance, the strongest-performing US industrial properties\u2019 returns in 2021 were mainly driven by exceptional yield compression. Thus, investors can use this information to better understand what factors are affecting the performance of different types of properties, and make more informed investment decisions based on this analysis.",

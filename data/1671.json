    "output": "Based on the analysis using MSCI's Low Carbon Transition Matrix, my investment portfolio has exposure to both carbon-transition risks and opportunities. About 40% of my portfolio is classified as transition-resilient, with low direct exposure to carbon-intensive sectors but potential indirect exposure through supply chains. Additionally, around 25% of my portfolio is categorized as having potential upside, with a focus on renewable energy, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient equipment. However, approximately 15% of my portfolio is classified as asset-stranding, with high exposure to carbon-intensive assets that may become obsolete or dependent on fossil-fuel activities. My portfolio also includes funds in the value-migration category, which have both high risk and high opportunity during the transition to low-carbon techniques. To manage these risks and take advantage of opportunities, I plan to integrate climate risk management strategies into my investment decisions, such as selecting companies with strong carbon risk management efforts and divesting from or tilting towards companies with high exposure to carbon-intensive assets.",

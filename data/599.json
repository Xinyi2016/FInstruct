    "output": "The increasing regulations to reduce plastic pollution pose a significant threat to the economics of petrochemical and O&G developments. The O&G companies such as PTT, Total, Formosa, and IRPC, which generate more than 25% of their revenue from petrochemical sales, may suffer severe consequences. As 80% of these petrochemicals are used as building blocks for plastic materials, the restrictions on single-use plastics can severely impact the demand for petrochemicals. The EU has enforced restrictions on single-use plastics, including a requirement to recycle more than 90% of beverage bottles by 2025. This trend is not limited to the EU, as restrictions on single-use plastics are implemented in 60 countries and approximately 350 U.S. municipalities. If this trend continues, petroleum assets intended as plastic inputs could end up being stranded. Hence, the O&G companies should start exploring alternatives and diversifying their portfolio to minimize the risks.",

    "instruction": "Please review the charts and provide a recommendation on whether to implement the more aggressive approach for the portfolio, which focuses on climate and green solutions.",
    "output": "Based on the performance of the MSCI indexes from May 2014 to August 2021, it appears that the more aggressive approach focusing on climate and green solutions may have a higher risk but also higher return potential compared to the market-capitalization reference. I would recommend implementing the 25% impact sleeve with green solutions and the remaining 75% in a core sleeve that tilts towards climate to align with the client's preference for a more aggressive approach. However, it's important to continuously refine the weighting and composition of the core and impact sleeves based on the client's intensity preference to maximize the portfolio's impact and performance.",

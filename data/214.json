    "output": "The critic-only approach, which uses only the action-value function to make decisions with the aim of maximizing the expected reward for each action choice given the current state, has limitations when applied to financial markets. One of the main limitations is that it performs better on discrete state spaces, but stock prices are continuous. As a result, if a larger number of stocks or assets are selected, the state space and action space will grow exponentially, which will weaken the performance of DQN. Additionally, the approach may not be able to capture the complex relationships between different financial assets, which can lead to suboptimal decisions.",

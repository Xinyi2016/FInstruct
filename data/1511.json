    "instruction": "Please explain the difference between growth investing and thematic investing, and how they can complement each other.",
    "output": "Growth investing typically focuses on rising earnings and sales in a particular sector or industry. On the other hand, thematic investing is aligned with longer-term megatrends and focuses on companies that are likely to benefit from the trend, regardless of their current earnings or sales. Thematic investing can complement growth investing by identifying and investing in firms not traditionally considered growth companies, such as sustainable and energy-related firms. In fact, a simulated multi-thematic approach has outperformed traditional growth indexes in the past decade. Combining these two investment strategies can provide investors with a diversified portfolio of firms reflecting both short-term growth potential and long-term megatrend alignment.",

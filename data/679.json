    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed report on the monthly active factor exposures for both Fund 1 and Fund 2 from September 2009 to September 2019.",
    "output": "Based on our examination, we found that Fund 1 consistently had a positive value exposure throughout the 10-year period, with the highest exposure occurring in September 2011 at +0.36. On the other hand, Fund 2 showed fluctuations in its factor exposures, with a negative value exposure in some months and a positive growth exposure in others. The highest growth exposure for Fund 2 was in October 2017 at +0.39. It is important to note that both funds experienced changes in their factor exposures due to rebalances and market shifts, but Fund 2's exposure to growth is clearly inconsistent with a value-oriented strategy when compared to Fund 1.",

    "output": "The adoption of a more aggressive approach towards climate-focused investments through a mix of core and impact sleeves did not produce a significant change in carbon footprint. However, it nearly doubled the amount of revenue portfolio companies earned from renewable energy, electric cars and other businesses linked to a clean-energy economy. This change resulted in quadrupled revenues compared to a market-capitalization-only portfolio. Therefore, implementing such an approach can lead to positive returns on investment and promote a clean-energy economy.",

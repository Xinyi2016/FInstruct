What percentage of assets under management is accounted for by real estate as an alternative asset class? What were some of the challenges asset owners faced in integrating real estate into their portfolios from a risk perspective? How have some asset owners addressed these challenges through \"best practices\"?",
    "output": "According to the 2014 MSCI Asset Owner survey, the classic 60:40 mix of stocks and bonds has shifted to a 40:40:20 mix of stocks, bonds, and alternatives. Real estate accounts for about 35% of alternatives and around $700 billion of the total $10.3 trillion in assets under management. On average, the 138 asset owners surveyed held 6.7% of their total assets in real estate, which jumped to 7.9% when excluding the nine asset owners with no real estate.\n\nHowever, integrating real estate into portfolios from a risk perspective has been a challenge for many asset owners. Some of the challenges identified by the survey include the complexity of the real estate asset class, data limitations, and a weak understanding of the different roles that real estate can play in the overall portfolio. As a result, there has been a gulf between central risk functions and the real estate departments.\n\nTo address these challenges, some asset owners have adopted \"best practices\" that focus on three main dimensions: allocation, strategy, and implementation. These best practices include embracing greater clarity over the role of real estate in the portfolio, the use of robust models and data, the integration of real estate exposure into multi-asset-class and investment options for the asset class, developing a clear investment strategy, the use of appropriate benchmarks, and adopting measures to address the potential disconnect between strategic allocations and the implementation of the investment strategy.",

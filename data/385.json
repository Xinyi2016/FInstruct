    "output": "The Generalized Beta (GB) family of distributions is a class of continuous probability distributions that includes the Generalized Beta Prime (GB2) and Generalized Beta (GB1) limits, as well as the Generalized Inverse Gamma (GIGa) and Generalized Gamma (GGa) limits. This family of distributions is approached using a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) for a power of the variable, whose steady-state (stationary) probability density function (PDF) is a modified GB (mGB) distribution. The SDE approach allows for a lucid explanation of the transition between the latter two. The GB distribution allows for a long-range power-law behavior to be ultimately terminated at a finite value, making it useful in analyzing data with heavy tails. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the \"traditional\" GB, which belongs to the family generated by the regularized beta function, is crucial for analysis of the tails of the distribution. The GB/mGB distributions have been applied in analyzing fifty years of historical data on realized market volatility, specifically for S&P500, and have shown consistent behavior with that of negative Dragon Kings.",

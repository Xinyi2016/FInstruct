    "output": "Based on our analysis, the 60/40 portfolio experienced the largest initial one-year drawdowns during the scenarios starting in October 1973, April 2008, and October 2000. Although these scenarios eventually generated positive returns over the five-year period due to market recovery, their returns remained below average. While hedging tail risk may seem like a viable option to enhance longer-horizon returns, it can be costly to execute and requires careful timing. Thus, it is important to carefully consider the potential of shorter-term risk and the feasibility of hedging tail risk when making investment decisions.",

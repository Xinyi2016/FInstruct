    "output": "Sure, equity programs play a critical role in balancing innovation and risk for investors. By incorporating different components such as stock options, restricted shares, and performance-based equity incentives, companies can incentivize higher levels of innovation while also managing risk. This is particularly important in times of market volatility, such as the March correction in technology stocks, as investors can use equity programs to rebalance growth allocations and incorporate thematics that align with their investment goals. Ultimately, the effectiveness of equity programs in balancing innovation and risk is a key consideration for investors looking to optimize their returns and manage their exposure to market fluctuations.",

    "output": "The addition of the real estate sector to the GICS framework is important because it separates real estate companies from financial companies, recognizing the fundamental difference between the two. Investors globally are now able to speak the same language when it comes to these two types of companies, which improves investment research, portfolio management, and asset allocation. Additionally, the hypothetical return relative to the MSCI USA Index shows that the MSCI USA Real Estate Index has performed significantly better than the MSCI USA Financials Index, ex real estate from May 2006 through June 2019, making it a valuable sector to consider when making investment decisions.",

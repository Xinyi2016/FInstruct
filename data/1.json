    "output": "The energy and utilities sectors in China may be most at risk to heatwaves, according to a report using MSCI\u2019s Climate Value-at-Risk (VaR) model. Extreme heat is the second largest hazard type following coastal flooding, and the energy and utilities sectors contributed 33% of the weighted extreme heat VaR due to infrastructure disruptions, increased cooling costs and reduced productivity. In contrast, the consumer discretionary and financials sectors contributed a much lower potential loss percentage. However, the relative impacts each sector experiences are shown to change under different warming scenarios, with financials, telecommunication services, and real estate becoming some of the most sensitive to global warming under a 5\u00b0C warming scenario.",

    "output": "The increase in sovereign green bonds in the Bloomberg MSCI Green Bond Index has affected its risk and return profile, primarily due to the higher average effective duration of sovereign green bonds compared to other issuer types. This has resulted in an increase in the index's sensitivity to interest-rate movements. The weight of sovereign green bonds in the index has also increased between 2018 to 2023, contributing to its positive returns in USD from 2017 until late 2021, a period of relatively low and stable global interest rates. It is important for investors to note the difference in the risk profile of sovereign green bonds and the potential influence of sovereigns on the benchmark.",

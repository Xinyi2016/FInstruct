    "output": "The recent rise in real U.S. bond yields may have implications for the bond-equity hedge strategy. Traditionally, this strategy involves investing in both bonds and equities in order to diversify risk. However, as real yields continue to rise, bond prices may fall and investors may need to offset losses in their bond portfolios with gains in equities. If the rise in real yields is partly due to a reduction in the supply of savings coming into the U.S. from abroad, as some analysts suggest, this could put further downward pressure on equity returns. As a result, investors may need to consider alternative strategies or adjust their asset allocation to maintain their risk-reward profiles. For example, they may need to consider shorter-duration bonds or other fixed-income securities that are less exposed to potential increases in real U.S. bond yields. Alternatively, they may need to focus more on non-U.S. equities or other asset classes that are not as closely tied to U.S. interest rates.",

    "instruction": "Research the recent increase in loan limits for agency mortgage loans and the potential impact on ARM securitization.",
    "output": "The recent historic home-price appreciation prompted U.S. housing agencies to increase loan limits for 2022, which may qualify more agency mortgage loans for securitization. This increase in loan limits may give a booster shot to issuance of agency-ARM MBS, which has significantly lagged that of other ARM loans. The recent ARM loans have displayed favorable risk characteristics, with higher loan size, and been mostly retained in banks\u2019 portfolios. However, high-balance ARM loans usually don\u2019t qualify for GSE securitization due to the loan-size limit, despite their higher creditworthiness.",

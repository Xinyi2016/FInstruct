    "output": "The migrant boats are traveling farther out to sea before being rescued or identified by data-collecting actors due to two different phenomena. On the one hand, a growing share of incidents near the shore are likely filtered out of our datasets by LCG interceptions. This means that as the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) intercepts more boats near the shore, these incidents are not being included in the data collected by data-collecting actors. On the other hand, as the presence of rescue boats near the Libyan coast has declined, smugglers are aware that boats must go farther to increase their probability of rescue, and may adapt their strategies accordingly. This means that smugglers are intentionally launching smaller boats and shifting to wooden boats, and migrants on board may be delaying their decision to call for help until they are farther away from the Libyan coast. This weak evidence for the latter hypothesis may be seen by comparing incident records from Watch The Med/Alarm Phone to the other incident datasets; in recent periods, calls to Watch The Med/Alarm Phone appear to show a slightly larger shift away from land and into the EU SAR zone.",

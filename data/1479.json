    "instruction": "Write a brief explanation on how the availability of security-level financed-emissions estimates can impact investors' decision-making process when evaluating green bonds.",
    "output": "The availability of security-level financed-emissions estimates can provide investors with a quantitative way of comparing the environmental impact of green bonds with conventional issues. This allows for a more comprehensive approach when making relative-value decisions, as these estimates can be considered alongside yield, duration, and credit quality. Additionally, the use of financed-emissions estimates may prompt green-bond issuers to report on or provide their own estimates of financed emissions, which further supports investors' decision-making process. Ultimately, this approach can change how investors think about bond-market relative value and make it easier for them to measure bonds' environmental impact.",

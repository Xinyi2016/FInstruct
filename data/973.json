    "instruction": "Please provide your opinion on whether sustained board diversity actively contributes to differences in company environmental practices, or if women are simply more likely to join environmentally friendly companies.",
    "output": "As there is insufficient data to test whether correlation implies causation, it is difficult to say if sustained board diversity actively contributes to differences in company environmental practices. However, it is possible that women are more likely to join boards of environmentally friendly companies. Moving forward, it is important for companies to increase the percentage of seats held by women and strive to retain them. Understanding how board composition relates to other firm characteristics can inform investors, employees and customers about the benefits of increasing board diversity.",

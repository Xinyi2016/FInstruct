    "output": "One approach to align investment strategies with decarbonization pathways is to overweight companies that are on a credible decarbonization path or offer green solutions. It's also important to underweight firms that are poorly positioned for a low-carbon-economy transition and reduce exposure to physical risks. To reflect year-on-year \"self-decarbonization,\" you can shock your climate-scenario alignment model and use a climate index as the basis for investment products that work towards meeting Paris agreement targets. Another key consideration is to address transition risks by shifting capital from carbon-intensive to green assets. As such, climate indexes can play an important role as benchmarks for active managers or the basis of investment products. It's vital that climate index providers adopt a comprehensive approach to climate risks and opportunities, including stranded-asset risks by reducing the index carbon footprint, elevating the weights of companies with substantiated reduction targets, and reducing physical climate risk exposure. The MSCI Climate Paris Aligned Index is an example of an index that is aligned with TCFD recommendations and takes a holistic view of climate change risks and opportunities.",

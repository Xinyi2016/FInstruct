    "instruction": "Discuss the likelihood of Kessler Syndrome in LEO due to the increasing use of satellites for commercial applications.",
    "output": "The excess return on a satellite rises as launch costs fall, leading to more satellites being launched and increasing the risk of orbital congestion. Continued growth of the space economy may trigger Kessler Syndrome in the near future, even in regions with high natural renewability. Compliance with the 25-year rule is insufficient to ensure sustainable orbit use.",

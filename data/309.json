    "output": "Nestedness refers to the arrangement of activities within a system, where each activity is nested within a larger activity. In the context of economic and innovation systems, nestedness describes the structure of the activities in which different countries are competitive. The evolution of these systems is influenced by the dynamics of nestedness, as countries compete in different layers of activities related to the production of knowledge and goods. The competitiveness of countries in the layers of innovation and trade is correlated with their diversification, while the science layer displays some peculiar features. The increasingly modular structure of scientific domains leads to a trade-off between the need to diversify in order to evolve and the need to allocate resources efficiently. Collaborative patterns among developed nations reduce the necessity to be competitive in the less sophisticated fields, freeing resources for the more complex domains.",

    "output": "Figure 4 illustrates the result for specific parameter values. It shows that there is a parameter region where an RJV lowers project variety and hence the innovation probability compared to any simple equilibrium under competition. However, there is also a lightly shaded area in the figure that depicts the parameter region for which the innovation probability is higher with an RJV than with R&D competition. This means that the requirement of Assumption 1 that the budget is sufficiently small and the requirement from Proposition 1(ii) that it is sufficiently large are consistent. All RJVs that increase project variety or innovation probability compared to a simple equilibrium under R&D competition are profitable in this case. This is because, for the given parameterization, competition is moderate.",

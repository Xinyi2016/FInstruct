    "output": "Figure 12 shows the evolution of US imports of cheese from Spain before, during, and after the tariff period. Three categories account for most of imports: cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk, fresh cheese, and other cheeses containing cow\u2019s milk. Tariffs were imposed on the three varieties. However, the cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk category had a close variety which was not targeted by a tariff. Specifically, HTS codes 04069056 and 04069057 were targeted by an additional 25% tariff, whereas code 04069059 was not. In the rest of the categories, all alternative varieties were targeted by a tariff. The figure shows a large decrease in imports of the cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk targeted by tariffs and a big increase in the cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk not targeted by tariffs. In fact, the non-targeted variety more than compensated for the decrease in imports in the targeted varieties. These trends suggest that Spanish firms could switch rapidly from the targeted varieties to the non-targeted ones in their exports to the US. In contrast, in the categories without an alternative non-targeted variety, the decrease in imports is less intense than in the targeted sheep category.",

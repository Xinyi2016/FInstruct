    "output": "The energy sector played a crucial role in the performance of MSCI Climate Indexes in 2022. However, the year wasn't just about energy-sector performance. The MSCI Climate Indexes are generally overweight on the information technology sector, and this has historically aided their performance given the sector's outperformance in the past. The macroeconomic scenario was more conducive for cheaper companies, which led to a correction for growth stocks and the information technology sector. Moreover, a rise in geopolitical tensions translated into positive momentum for aerospace and defense companies. However, as the MSCI Climate Indexes exclude controversial-weapons companies, the outperformance of aerospace and defense companies adversely impacted their performance.",

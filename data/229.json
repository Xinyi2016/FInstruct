    "output": "The second strategy used by wine and cheese producers to avoid the negative impact of tariffs was to shift exports from tariff-targeted varieties to similar non-targeted varieties. For example, wines with an alcohol strength by volume of 14% or less were subject to an additional tariff, whereas wines with a higher alcohol strength were not. The alcoholic strength of red wines, the most important variety exported by Spain to the US, is in the 13-15 range. Therefore, it was feasible for exporters of red wine with an alcoholic strength equal or lower than 14% to shift their exports to higher alcoholic strength varieties to avoid the tariff. Regarding cheese, some varieties of cheese made from sheep\u2019s milk, the most important cheese variety exported by Spain to the US, were targeted by a tariff, whereas other similar ones were not. This enabled Spanish exporters to shift from the targeted to the non-targeted variety and avoid the negative impact of the tariff. I show that there was an actual change in the exported varieties and not a product reclassification to evade tariffs. I document that targeted varieties that were \u201cfar\u201d in product characteristics from the non-targeted ones (e.g., white wine and cheese made from cow\u2019s milk) experienced a much larger decrease in exports than the \u201cclose\u201d ones.",

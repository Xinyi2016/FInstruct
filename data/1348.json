    "instruction": "As an investor, analyze the potential risk of wildfires on your portfolio.",
    "output": "According to our analysis, the majority of assets owned by MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index constituents are in areas with low current or future wildfire risk, and the projected direct costs from wildfires for these firms are relatively low. However, we have identified a high risk for assets concentrated in wildfire hotspots such as Central America and Southeast Asia. Considering the increase in severe wildfires expected due to global warming and a higher probability of heatwaves and arid conditions, it is crucial to assess and manage the potential risk of wildfires on your portfolio. Wildfires have a significant effect on global carbon emissions and can potentially increase costs from physical risks for companies. As an investor, it is essential to keep these considerations in mind while making investment decisions.",

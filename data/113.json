    "output": "The findings suggest that the common strategy of inferring unobservable variables using firm first-order conditions (FOC) might yield biased estimates. This strategy is widely used in research within the structural tradition, particularly in the context of understanding imperfect competition in the labor market. The results indicate that not all firms fully optimize with respect to wages, which implies that the FOC do not always characterize firms' pricing decisions. Therefore, future research should aim to quantify the size of these deviations and assess if they lead to significant biases in the estimation of parameter values.",

    "instruction": "Based on the information provided, generate a response that discusses the potential impact of short-run needs on depressive symptoms and subjective well-being in the Nigerian context.",
    "output": "Short-run needs, such as everyday use, business purposes, medical expenses, paying house/shop rent, and emergencies, are the most common reasons that our sample reports taking a loan (Figure A11). These needs could reduce the depressive symptoms observed in Figure 1.19. Additionally, the auto-approval treatment, which causes people to borrow less from friends and family, may contribute to the increase in subjective well-being. This may be especially true in the Nigerian context, where rates of depression and mental disorder are quite high. According to our endline surveys, 47% of our sample was screened as having mild depression and 10% as having moderate or severe depression. By comparison, only 12.5% of individuals in the US reported some level of psychological distress.",

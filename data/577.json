    "output": "The recent drawdown in beta exposure has resulted in investors selling out of high-beta stocks or rotating from higher beta into lower beta ones. This trend has been observed across growth, value, and many industry-focused strategies and has implications for both quantitative and fundamental managers. The fourth quarter rotation in the US saw higher risk stock giving back all their gains by mid-October before falling even further to end the year. Meanwhile, lower-risk stocks ended the year 5% ahead of the market. Other developed markets showed similar rotations to the US, but this was not the case in emerging markets. The sell-off in those markets was more indiscriminate and broad-based. High-beta stocks' underperformance was concentrated in the FAANGs, but low-beta stocks' outperformance was more indiscriminate, spanning many sectors beyond the historically defensive ones. Monitoring beta exposures can be beneficial for investors in mitigating risks associated with market fluctuations.",

    "instruction": "Please explain the significance of Scope 3 categories 1, 11, and 15 in relation to the total carbon footprint of constituents in the MSCI USA Investable Market Index.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that the total carbon footprint of constituents in the MSCI USA Investable Market Index is largely influenced by Scope 3 categories 1, 11, and 15, which pertain to purchased goods and services, use of sold products and investments, respectively. These three categories accounted for 75% of value-chain emissions across all sectors represented in the index. This finding underscores the importance of considering not just direct emissions but also indirect emissions associated with supply chains and product use when assessing a company's carbon footprint. Moreover, our analysis suggests that these categories are likely to meet the SEC's threshold for materiality, meaning that companies may be required to disclose their emissions in these areas. By anchoring its disclosure requirements on a quantitative benchmark, the SEC can promote greater transparency and consistency in reporting and help investors make more informed decisions.",

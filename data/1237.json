    "output": "The OECD's composite leading indicator has been rising significantly since May 2020 and appears to have stabilized in October 2021. Analyst expectations for earnings also remain strong, as seen through the short-term forward earnings per share of the MSCI World Index, which stands at a healthy level of around 10%, as of October 2021. This normalization from an unprecedented nearly 25% earlier in the year suggests continued growth over 2022, potentially driven by continued demand as economies open further. Overall, these indicators suggest a positive outlook for economic growth and corporate earnings in the near future.",

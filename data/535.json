    "output": "As the world recovers from the long-term effects of the pandemic and several structural changes, deglobalization is one of the many things top-of-mind for investors globally. Investors may wish to consider the implications and insights discussed here, as they choose to reallocate portfolios and position themselves for a potential new paradigm.\n\nThe shift from global to national/local output gaps and resource constraints, plus lower productivity and growth trends, ultimately may help raise the rate of inflation. At the same time, this transition is potentially deflationary, as it could trigger a new wave of bank deleveraging and tests of credit/fiscal sustainability. In combination, this could mean greater inflation volatility and a worsening trade-off between growth and inflation.\n\nThe impact of inflation on equity portfolios depends on the underlying causes. Our previous work using scenario analysis indicated that historically, growth delivered positive active returns in low-inflation environments, and negative active returns in moderate-to-high-inflation environments. On the other hand, value stocks with high cash flows have outperformed in high-inflation environments. Low volatility delivered stronger performance in both moderate- and high-inflation environments, as corporate cash flows might have been positively exposed to inflation. Quality and momentum were less sensitive to inflation and outperformed in all scenarios.\n\nInvestors should consider the potential impact of deglobalization on their portfolios and adjust accordingly. This may involve reallocating assets to take advantage of potential opportunities, as well as mitigating risks associated with the changing economic landscape. By staying informed and proactive, investors can position themselves for success in the new paradigm.",

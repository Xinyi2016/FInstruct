    "output": "The nestedness of the network in the scientific collaboration network refers to the arrangement of countries based on their level of specialization and competitiveness in different scientific domains. A more nested network indicates that countries tend to collaborate with other countries that specialize in similar scientific domains, while countries that specialize in different domains are less likely to collaborate. This pattern of nestedness suggests that countries are forming clusters or modules based on their areas of expertise, which can facilitate the exchange of knowledge and resources within each cluster. The stability of the nestedness in the significant region considering both the Temperature and the NODF estimations suggests that this pattern of specialization and collaboration is consistent over time and across different metrics used to measure collaboration. The emergence of two denser regions in the country layer, one consisting of the most diversified and competitive nations and the other consisting of less competitive nations, further highlights the importance of nestedness in shaping the organization of scientific collaboration at the national level.",

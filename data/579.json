    "output": "Market volatility had a significant impact on trading costs and liquidity in both emerging and developed market debt in 2018. While transaction costs remained stable throughout the year, large rises in credit spread levels were followed by increased bid-ask spreads, making it expensive to reduce exposure within a particularly short time-frame. Timing of trades by as little as a couple of days had significant impacts on trading costs because of decreased liquidity. The breakdown of the historic bond-equity hedging relationship added to the challenge for investors. According to a recent client survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, vanishing liquidity climbed to the top of the list of fears for credit investors. Our research shows that investors' concerns about increased transaction costs in major credit shocks were justified. However, the liquidity shocks tended to be shorter than the credit shocks, and liquidity fell back to long-term levels relatively quickly. Despite this, delaying trading decisions may have been a viable strategy for some investors.",

    "output": "The proposed deep CNN regression model outperforms all other models based on the mean absolute difference, mean squared error, and maximum deviation. Three out of four regression models significantly outperform all other models based on the mean difference metric. All regression models perform better than all classification models, indicating that the prediction task should be framed as a regression task. The approach by Sokolov et al. (Sokolov, Mostovoy, Ding & Seco, 2021) shows quite poor performance.",

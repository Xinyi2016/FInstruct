    "output": "Rising firm differences and greater market power can amplify and prolong aggregate fluctuations, making the economy more vulnerable to shocks and more likely to experience prolonged slumps. This is because large, high markup firms have more pricing power and can pass on cost increases to consumers, leading to larger price adjustments and greater volatility in economic activity. Additionally, the reallocation of activity towards these firms can lead to a decline in competition, which can further exacerbate the impact of shocks on the economy.",

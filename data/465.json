    "output": "The two approaches for determining offers and computing signals in multi-agent systems are the performance-based strategy and the interdependence-based strategy. The performance-based strategy focuses on increasing immediate performance contributions without considering long-term effects. Agents using this strategy offer tasks in their area of responsibility that are associated with the minimum performance, and they hope for compensation payments that are higher than the utility they would receive from performing the tasks on their own. This behavior aligns with the concept of myopic utility maximization (Simon, 1967). In contrast, the interdependence-based strategy does not prioritize short-term utility. Instead, it follows the concept of the mirroring hypothesis, which means that agents aim to minimize interdependencies between their own and other agents\u2019 areas of responsibility (Colfer and Baldwin, 2016). They hope that this will lead to greater control and higher utility in the long run. Overall, the choice of strategy affects the way that agents behave and the decisions they make.",

    "instruction": "Please explain why the current HPA is different from the one in 2005, despite some similarities.",
    "output": "The current record-setting HPA is different from the one in 2005 because it occurred during a severe economic recession brought on by the pandemic, while the 2005 HPA was not influenced by such a recession. However, there are some similarities between the two, such as the fact that house-price growth has rapidly exceeded household income growth. This has resulted in housing affordability decreasing rapidly to levels seen in the early 2000s, despite mortgage rates being much lower than they were in the 2000s.",

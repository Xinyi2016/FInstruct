    "instruction": "Explain the concept of bubble riding behavior in the context of the simulation results.",
    "output": "Bubble riding behavior refers to the tendency of players in the simulation to initially slow down their trading speed in order to ride the bubble, or take advantage of a temporary price increase. This behavior can be observed in the increasing selling speed before the endogenous burst, which leads to a concave-shaped inventory curve, in contrast to the convex inventory curve found in standard optimal execution MFGs. The presence of the bubble creates a sense of urgency among the players to collectively attack it, which results in the slowdown of trading speed initially.",

    "instruction": "Analyze the exhibits and explain how sector exposures affected the performance of the two growth strategies.",
    "output": "The exhibits show that sector exposures played a significant role in the performance of the two growth strategies. For the more recent period, the factor-controlled strategy had limited exposure to sectors, while the simple growth strategy had significant exposure to several sectors, including information technology (IT). The simple growth strategy had an average active exposure of about 14% to IT over the period, and it outperformed the market by 9.1%. This strong performance of IT was a big contributor to the simple growth strategy\u2019s overall outperformance. The exhibits also indicate that the factor-controlled strategy had a more balanced exposure to various sectors, which resulted in lower returns compared to the simple growth strategy\u2019s concentrated exposure to certain sectors. In conclusion, the exhibits demonstrate that sector exposures played a significant role in determining the performance of the two growth strategies.",

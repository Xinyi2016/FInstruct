    "output": "Jumps refer to sudden and unexpected changes in asset prices that cannot be explained by gradual changes in market fundamentals. These jumps can occur in both volatility and price, and can have a significant impact on the behavior of financial markets. To model jumps, financial analysts use a variety of techniques, including stochastic volatility models and models that incorporate correlated jumps. These models are used to estimate the probability of jumps occurring and to forecast their impact on asset prices. However, modeling jumps in decentralized assets (DA) can be challenging due to the different market microstructure and the rapid changes in market behavior.",

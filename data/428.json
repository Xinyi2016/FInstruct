    "output": "The literature on the behavior of stock prices during periods of MNA dates back at least to Schwert (1981). Pearce and Roley (1985) find that money supply is the only MNA, which affects stock returns. Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989) use vector autoregression on monthly data to quantify the fraction of returns, driven by macroeconomic news. McQueen and Roley (1993) suggest that response of the stock market to MNA may depend on the business cycle. They find a positive response to good news during periods of low growth and a negative response during a boom. Flannery and Protopapadakis (2002) argue that the nonlinearity and time dependence of the effects of MNA makes them hard to detect. They focus on the response of market volatility to MNA and find that money supply and inflation are the most important MNA. Boyd, Hu, and Jagannathan (2005) study market response to unemployment news and find that on average bad unemployment news has a positive effect on stocks. They explain this result by the hypothesis that during expansions market perceives unemployment news as news about interest rates rather than economic growth. Law, Song, and Yaron (2020) use the New Keynesian model to argue that the stock response to MNA surprise is the strongest during periods of a low output gap. My paper reinterprets the results in the papers above by showing that monetary uncertainty is the driver of state dependence of stock response to MNA. Since monetary uncertainty is often the lowest during early recovery, previous research misattributed time variation in this response to business cycles rather than monetary uncertainty. I show that the stage of the business cycle has little explanatory power after controlling for monetary uncertainty.",

    "output": "Dear Institutional Investors,\n\nAs we continue to navigate the current market sell-off, it is important to consider the historical performance of high-quality firms. These firms have proven to be resilient during downturns, outperforming both growth and value segments of the market in the U.S., international, and emerging markets.\n\nIn fact, the start of 2022 has seen a winter chill through stocks, with equities cooling as rising inflation, interest-rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions spook equity investors. However, high-quality firms have fared relatively well during this downturn.\n\nSteve Jobs once said that quality is the best business plan, and the historical record suggests that he may have been onto something. As such, it may be worth remeasuring, reassessing, and managing your quality exposure during times of market turbulence.\n\nFor more information on the historical outperformance of high-quality firms during market sell-offs, please see the attached presentation.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",

    "output": "To develop a system-level model that estimates how migrants and smugglers react to changes in the crossing environment, we would need to gather data on the current migration patterns, smuggling networks, and border enforcement measures. This data would then be used to create a simulation model that can predict how changes in the crossing environment would affect the behavior of migrants and smugglers. The model would take into account various factors such as the cost of smuggling services, the risk of detection and apprehension, and the availability of alternative routes. The model would also account for the adaptability of smugglers and migrants, as well as their willingness to take risks. The model would be validated using historical data and tested with different scenarios to assess its accuracy and usefulness in informing migration policies.",

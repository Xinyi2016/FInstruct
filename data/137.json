    "output": "In the given scenario, we have a duopoly with two symmetric firms competing in the R&D competition game. Each firm chooses how much to invest in each R&D project from a continuum of alternatives, with the goal of maximizing expected profits. The projects are identical except that some are more costly than others, and firms have a fixed budget that can be used for R&D investments. They can also borrow externally at a positive interest rate to supplement their budget. The firms choose their investment strategy to maximize expected profits, and we assume that the budget is sufficiently small that both firms borrow positive amounts from the financial markets in equilibrium.\nThe alternative to the R&D competition game is the RJV, where the two firms combine their budgets and choose R&D investments to maximize joint payoffs. Firms share the research costs equally, and if successful, both receive the innovation. After the R&D outcomes materialize, the firms compete in the product market.\nIn summary, the R&D competition game involves two firms competing to invest in R&D projects to maximize their profits, while the RJV involves the two firms collaborating to invest in R&D projects to maximize their joint profits.",

    "instruction": "Can you provide a summary of the comparison between the four global MSCI ESG indexes and their parent indexes during the COVID-19 sell-off and for longer periods?",
    "output": "Sure, our analysis showed that MSCI's GEM Model with an ESG factor indicated a significant portion of the indexes' Q1 2020 performance was due to the systematic tilt of these indexes towards higher ESG-rated stocks, similar to what we observed over the past five years. Additionally, several regional and sub-regional ESG indexes outperformed their market-cap-weighted parent index during Q1 2020, but some approaches underperformed in emerging markets. Our previous research examined whether companies with high MSCI ESG Ratings are more resilient to shocks during the study period and found that they were. The COVID-19 outbreak provided the first real-world test of this resilience since the 2008 global financial crisis. The pandemic started in emerging markets and quickly spread to developed markets, which have been the hardest-hit regions in terms of the number of people infected. Overall, the exhibit below shows the relative cumulative performance of\u00a0four standard global MSCI ESG equity indexes integrating MSCI ESG Ratings\u00a0compared to their MSCI ACWI Index parent index in the first quarter; longer-term annualized results are shown below as well.",

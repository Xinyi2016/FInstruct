    "output": "Thank you for the instruction. I have read the Chinese core points and important Q&A related to MSCI China Research Director Wei Zhen's commentary. It seems that China is progressing well in the recovery stage while different countries in the Asia-Pacific region are at different stages of the epidemic outbreak and recovery. Investors have also started using big data or alternative data to determine the economic recovery situation, besides traditional data. China's economic recovery has a more significant impact on the global stock market than during the 2003 SARS period due to its share in global trade and MSCI emerging market index weight. Moreover, investors in the region have shown renewed interest in sustainable investment during the epidemic. The pandemic has reflected how sustainable investment plays a role in different investors' strategic asset positioning, and ESG and sustainable investment strategies have demonstrated resilience during this period. In times of market volatility, investors who prioritize long-term investment and have suitable tools and data are more likely to capture investment opportunities that arise during an economic rebound.",

    "output": "The relationship between globalization and greenhouse gas emissions is ambiguous and depends on various factors. According to the theory proposed by Grossman and Krueger (1991), the expected sign is ambiguous for both variables. Globalization could increase pollution if trade and capital flows induce an economic expansion and investments are directed to emission-intensive production (Dinda, 2008; Sirag et al., 2018; Phong, 2019). However, if globalization is associated with the diffusion of efficient and environmentally friendly technologies and institutions, it could negatively affect GHG emissions (Runge, 1994; Wheeler, 2000; Jayadevappa and Chhatre, 2000; Liddle, 2001; Cole, 2006). The \"Pollution Haven\" Hypothesis suggests that polluting industries may relocate from developed economies with tight environmental regulation to countries beginning the industrialization phase and with few environmental regulations (Copeland and Taylor, 2004). Previous literature finds mixed results for the trade openness variable (Lee et al., 2009; You et al., 2015). Recent works have focused on other measures of globalization, such as the KOF globalization index, which has been found to be negatively correlated with CO2 emissions in Turkey and India (Shahbaz et al., 2013; Shahbaz et al., 2015) and positively related to Japan and twenty-five developed economies (Shahbaz et al., 2017a; Shahbaz et al., 2017b).",

    "output": "As a member of the board of an emissions-intensive company, it is crucial to evaluate the findings of the recent study on governance practices and emissions reduction. The study suggests that boards that prioritize environmental sustainability and include directors with climate experience can help firms address climate-transition risk and reduce real-world emissions. As our analysis reveals, only a minority of companies in emissions-intensive industries have climate-focused boards. Therefore, it is essential to assess whether our board needs to prioritize environmental sustainability and add directors with climate experience. Doing so is likely to help build support for emissions targets and align with global temperature targets. In turn, this will not only benefit the environment but also provide competitive advantages in the long run.",

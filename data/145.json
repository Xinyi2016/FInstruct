    "output": "R&D project choice refers to the decision-making process that firms undergo when determining which research and development projects to invest in. In a model with R&D project choice, an RJV (Research Joint Venture) can result in an efficiency at the investment stage by reducing the amount of duplication of research projects. This duplication reduction effect of the RJV makes it less costly to sustain high innovation probabilities. However, a potential countervailing effect needs to be taken into account, as escaping competition can be very valuable for each individual firm. Thus, compared with an RJV, incentives for innovation may be higher for a firm that can fully appropriate the benefits from innovation as the single successful innovator under R&D competition.",

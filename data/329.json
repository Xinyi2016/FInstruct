    "output": "The study found that scaling is a promising approach for assessing the environmental impact of companies based on simple metrics and available data. The results showed a significant relationship between environmental impact variables and size, with changes in size resulting in changes in environmental impact. The study also found that industries typically scale sublinearly, with some industries scaling superlinearly possibly due to economies of scale. The implications of these findings for setting environmental benchmarks and targets are twofold: 1) not only the sector, but also the size must be considered in bench-marking; 2) when the sector scales sublinearly, the bigger the company, the easier it will be to reduce its environmental impact. To set the benchmark, total revenue should be selected as the explanatory variable, followed by the number of employees and total assets. The study suggests that the supply chain network, rather than the social network of stakeholders, is the underlying network that generates the scaling relationship.",

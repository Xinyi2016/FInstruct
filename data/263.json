The first community includes countries that maintained lower or moderate levels of the Stringency Index, such as Sweden, United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. The second community consists of countries that upgraded the SI to a high level and kept it for a while, including Italy, Central European countries, countries that was belonging to the former Yugoslavia, Portugal, Israel, and India.

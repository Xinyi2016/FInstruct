    "output": "The proposed methodology for the COVID-19 network has identified two relevant communities. The first cluster includes most part of European countries, United Kingdom, Unites States and Australia. These countries share a similar pattern of disease diffusion in the analysed period, characterized by a first wave occurring in the spring of 2020, followed by a consistent reduction in the spread of the virus in the summer and a resumption of the epidemic activity in 2020 with second and/or third waves. The second cluster includes Asian, Eurasian, Central American and African countries, which were characterized by a lower incidence in the first wave. Sweden is also present in this group, characterized by an anomalous behaviour in that period with respect to other Nordic regions.",

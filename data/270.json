    "output": "To develop a model that accounts for behavioral responses and the open-access condition in the context of the 25-year rule, we can use the framework provided by Rao and Letizia (2021). However, we will need to make some modifications to their model to account for the open-access condition and to extend their analysis beyond the short run. Specifically, we will need to:\n\n1. Enforce the open-access condition by ensuring that all operators have equal access to the orbital space.\n2. Extend the analysis beyond 2030 to consider the long-run implications of the 25-year rule.\n3. Consider the impact of Kessler Syndrome on the behavior of operators in the LEO.\n\nBy incorporating these modifications, we can develop a more comprehensive model that accounts for the behavioral responses of operators and the open-access condition in the context of the 25-year rule. This will allow us to better understand the long-run implications of the rule and to identify potential solutions to prevent Kessler Syndrome.",

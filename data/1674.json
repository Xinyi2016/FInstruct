    "output": "In a rising financial market, many institutional investors are turning to leveraged loans for their attractive yields and potential hedge against rising interest rates. However, as the leveraged loan market has surpassed $1 trillion, protection for investors has declined as companies have increasingly issued cov-lite loans, which offer less downside protection compared to covenant loans. Cov-lite loans may provide higher returns in normal market conditions, but during periods of market turbulence, potential losses have been more severe for cov-lite loans compared to covenant loans. Investors must weigh the benefits of cov-lite loans against the compensation they are receiving for their more mercurial risks. Ultimately, investors need to closely examine the trade-offs embedded in the current market environment, particularly with respect to the changing nature of the loan market.",

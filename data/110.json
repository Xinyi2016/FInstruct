    "output": "Nonstandard wage-setting refers to firm wage-setting practices that depart from the first-order condition of canonical wage-formation models. This concept is important because it helps to understand the behavior of firms and how they set wages. By disentangling the two explanations for wage bunching, we can better understand who benefits from this behavior and inform the modeling assumptions of wage-setting models. This can ultimately lead to a more accurate understanding of the labor market and help policymakers make informed decisions.",

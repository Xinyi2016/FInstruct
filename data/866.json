    "output": "Based on the exhibit below, country factors appear to be the most significant contributor to systematic cross-sectional volatility for both the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index, explaining 40% to 80% of CSV from December 2004 to June 2020. On the other hand, the contributions from sectors and style factors were relatively lower for both indices. This suggests that investors should pay close attention to country-level risks when investing in emerging market or Asia-Pacific equities, as opposed to sectors or styles. \n\nOverall, the wide dispersion of country-index returns highlights the importance of diversification and risk management strategies to manage country-specific risks. \n\n\n[Exhibit]\n\n|         | Sector Factors | Style Factors | Country Factors |\n|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| EM Index | 10-35%               | 10-25%               | 40-80%               |\n| ACAP   | 20-45%              | 5-20%                | 40-80%               |",

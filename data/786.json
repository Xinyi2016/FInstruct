    "instruction": "Please explain the three methods that were explored to construct a COVID-19 factor.",
    "output": "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we explored three methods to construct a COVID-19 factor that is a linear combination of existing GEMTR factors. The three methods assumed that the impacts of COVID-19 were already captured by the GEMTR factors. The factors produced by the three methods were all similar to one another and produced a factor that was anti-correlated to the market returns during the crisis period. While it is difficult to argue how to define a \u201ctrue\u201d COVID-19 factor, we believe the results presented could provide a reasonable estimate to a portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to the impacts of COVID-19.",

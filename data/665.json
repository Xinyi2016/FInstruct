    "instruction": "Please explain how the concentration of global markets has changed in recent years, including the roles of both private and public companies.",
    "output": "In recent years, global markets have become increasingly concentrated, with several large, publicly traded technology companies attaining dominant roles in terms of portfolio allocation and performance. At the same time, many new growth companies such as Uber and Airbnb have remained private and continued to rely on private sources of funding for longer periods. This trend suggests a shift away from the traditional IPO model and towards a more exclusive approach to investing and wealth creation.",

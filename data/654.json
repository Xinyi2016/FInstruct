    "output": "Over the past three decades, emerging markets have grown significantly, representing 12% of global equities as reflected by the MSCI ACWI Index. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index now covers 26 countries, up from just 10 in 1988, and has outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index by 250 basis points on average per annum. However, it's important to note that emerging markets' headline performance can hide a wide dispersion of country outcomes, with their performance more affected by their underlying country than by their sector or style exposure. Investors with strong views should understand how EM countries react differently to macroeconomic factors, such as the U.S.-China trade war and the price of oil.",

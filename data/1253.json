    "output": "\"One strategy to manage the exposure of a corporate bond portfolio to climate transition risk is to tilt the portfolio towards issuers with overall higher ESG ratings in order to underweight companies in energy and materials. This would aim to improve the GHG footprint of the portfolio. However, it may be difficult to consistently decarbonize the portfolio across all credit segments due to varying investment philosophies and sustainability targets among investors and asset owners. Therefore, a combination of approaches should be adapted to address climate transition risk in the portfolio. This could include engaging with issuers to improve their ESG ratings and carbon footprint, as well as incorporating climate risk considerations into the investment process. Ultimately, the approach taken should be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the investor or asset owner.\"",

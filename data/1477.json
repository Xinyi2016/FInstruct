    "output": "The financed-emissions metric, based on the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials' methodology, provides a quantitative basis to compare green and non-green bonds. This allows investors to consider a new green bond's financed-emission estimate alongside yield, duration, and credit quality, when making relative-value and investment decisions for bond portfolios. This methodology fills the void of highly qualitative and not detailed enough in terms of climate metrics information about the projects which green bonds finance. The use of this methodology can help investors make more informed investment decisions by providing a reliable and standardized metric to evaluate the environmental impacts of green bonds. As a result, investors can better assess the potential risks and returns of their investment and make a positive impact on the environment.",

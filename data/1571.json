    "instruction": "Can you summarize the impact of the third quarter on the MSCI ACWI ESG index?",
    "output": "The third quarter saw a lot of economic turbulence, including market fluctuations, a sharp rise in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and a strong US dollar. Like the first half of the year, these conditions had a negative impact on the MSCI ACWI ESG index. However, the underlying factors for each period were different. Currently, the index has a slight negative US asset allocation, and the recent strong dollar had a negative impact on currency factors (see table below). In the third quarter, there was no positive contribution to ESG factors, but allocation to carbon-efficient companies within each sector did have a positive impact. However, specific exclusions within individual companies had a significant negative impact on performance.",

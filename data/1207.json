    "instruction": "Review case study 3 on overall ESG rating and provide an analysis on how regulatory changes such as decarbonization, anti-monopoly, and anti-corruption measures may impact a company's ESG rating.",
    "output": "Based on the case study, regulatory changes such as decarbonization, anti-monopoly, and anti-corruption measures may have long-term effects on a company's ESG rating and could be reflected in key ESG indicators used by MSCI ESG research. Depending on the industry, a company's overall ESG rating may reflect the risks and opportunities that such regulatory changes may bring. Companies with high energy efficiency or low carbon emissions are likely to be less affected by downward risks associated with new regulations during the decarbonization movement. MSCI China ESG Leader Index, which selects the top 50% ESG-rated companies from MSCI China Index, outperformed its parent index by 2.9% during the period of intensive regulatory requirements from January to July this year. In addition, MSCI China Climate Change Index had 70% lower carbon emissions than MSCI China Index, and outperformed by 1.1% during the same period.",

    "output": "\"Based on the instruction, I have created a portfolio with the objective of achieving dynamic composition without incurring significant risks. I have applied constraints such as limiting the percentage allocation of individual stocks to avoid excessive weightings and rebalancing the portfolio periodically to maintain its desired mix. These constraints will help mitigate the risks of high portfolio turnover rate, ensuring a balanced and stable investment strategy over time.\"",

    "output": "Hicksian Equivalent Variation is a measure of welfare change used in CGE models. It represents the amount of resources that need to be transferred between individuals or sectors in order to maintain their original level of welfare in the face of a policy change or external shock. In other words, it measures the efficiency loss or gain of a policy or shock, taking into account the price changes and market interactions between sectors that are included in CGE models. This measure is important because it allows policymakers to assess the overall impact of a policy or shock on the economy, including the distribution of welfare effects across different sectors and individuals.",

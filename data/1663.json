    "output": "The historically low yields in private real estate pose challenges for commercial real estate investors. In the short term, low yields might be considered a risk factor for investors with higher total-return expectations. Low yields mean that investors wanting to maintain higher total-return targets will be more reliant on capital growth tied to increases in net operating income (NOI). In the longer term, it is not clear whether the shift toward lower real estate yields is sustainable, and rising interest rates could cause a repricing of real estate assets. The impact of rising rates on real estate values will probably depend on whether rates rise in response to improved growth, to curb inflation in a stagflation scenario, or rates rise too soon, stifling growth. The risks faced by investors will vary greatly depending on the individual real estate assets in their portfolios, and informed real estate investors may want to take a close look at their holdings to see how they are positioned.",

    "instruction": "Please interpret the findings of the adaptive multi-factor model.",
    "output": "Based on the adaptive multi-factor model, we have found that there is a slight overweight on low size and value, and an underweight on yield and low volatility. Momentum and quality, however, are neutral. Overall, this suggests that the current investment strategy may need to be adjusted to better align with our desired risk profile and investment goals. We recommend reviewing and potentially rebalancing the portfolio based on these findings.",

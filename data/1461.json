    "instruction": "Can you provide an explanation for the negative specific-return contribution of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes in the third quarter?",
    "output": "Yes, the negative specific-return contribution during the third quarter was particularly significant for the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index, which aims to include the most highly-rated ESG companies in each sector while excluding those with ongoing ESG controversies. The underperformance was largely due to the exclusion of companies such as Apple and Amazon, which were involved in controversies related to their customers and governance. Additionally, the four largest holdings in the MSCI ACWI Index, namely Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc., contributed over 12% of the index weight and more than half of the negative specific return of the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index in the third quarter. While Microsoft and Alphabet were included in the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index during the second quarter, they continued to detract from performance in the third quarter.",

    "output": "After analyzing the emissions-data estimates, we have identified the Scope 3 categories that companies have reported to the CDP as \"relevant\" for their business. We have found that there are disparities in opinions among companies about what is considered material. For example, in the financial sector, financed emissions accounted for an overwhelming proportion of the total carbon footprint, but only one out of the 54 companies viewed these emissions as relevant. In the consumer-discretionary sector, purchased goods and services accounted for an estimated 30% of their total emissions footprint, but around 90% of the sector considers these emissions relevant. However, when it comes to products sold, only 54% of companies in the sector deemed it relevant despite accounting for 44% of the industry\u2019s total GHG emissions. We recognize that this lack of uniformity of opinion among companies could impede like-for-like analysis.",

    "instruction": "Explain the results of the study and compare the findings using the Bernini et al. [2018] classification and the Rauch [1999] classification.",
    "output": "The study found that a positive import cost shock leads to a persistent drop in exported quantities of differentiated goods but not for undifferentiated goods. The results showed that the estimated coefficient for exported quantities of differentiated goods is between 15% and 37% greater than those found for the full sample in Table 2, across time horizons, under the Bernini et al. [2018] classification. However, under the Rauch [1999] classification, the estimated coefficients are between 0.5% and 26% across time periods. The study also found that the estimated coefficients for undifferentiated products are not significantly different from zero across any of the time periods. These findings suggest that differentiated goods are more sensitive to import cost shocks than undifferentiated goods, which is in line with the theoretical framework's predictions.",

    "instruction": "Can you explain the difference between growth and thematic investing based on the example of Novo Nordisk A/S and Johnson & Johnson?",
    "output": "Sure. Growth investing is characterized by companies that have a strong track record of rising earnings and sales, while thematic investing is based on economic linkages to long-term, structural megatrends. In the case of Novo Nordisk A/S and Johnson & Johnson, Novo Nordisk is classified as a growth firm due to its superior forward earnings estimates and sustainable growth rate compared to Johnson & Johnson. Although both companies are century-old pharmaceutical firms, Novo Nordisk's recent growth performance makes it more suitable for inclusion in the Growth index.",

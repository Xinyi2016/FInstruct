    "output": "Sustained yield compression helped global gateway cities produce superior long-term capital growth, but it also made them more expensive than other markets, which led to a shift towards secondary markets. According to a recent analysis, net income yields hit a record low in 14 out of the 30 largest city-level office markets in the MSCI Global Annual Property Index. As a result, there has been a gradual increase in the capital allocated to offices outside of the five main global and regional gateway cities in the U.S. From 2017 to June 2020, 45.7% of purchases by value took place in secondary markets, higher than the 45.4% for global and regional gateway cities. This trend is also noticeable in smaller office markets outside the top 20. In conclusion, sustained yield compression has impacted the global office market and led to a shift towards more affordable secondary markets.",

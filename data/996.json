    "output": "Value indexes have historically outperformed their parent indexes during the recovery and expansion phases of the economic cycle. However, in the last 15 years, value investments have had a challenging time. Recently, the reopening of the global economy following the COVID-19 vaccination rollout, combined with an increase in long-term interest rates and inflation expectations, has reignited interest in value investments. Inflows into value ETFs have outpaced those of growth ETFs in the last six months. While investors have questioned the viability of value investments, the current outlook for value strategies, be it among stocks, sectors, countries or regions, is positive. The exhibit below shows the active returns of the MSCI World Factor Indexes during various recovery periods, as well as the information ratios (IR) in different macroeconomic cycles.",

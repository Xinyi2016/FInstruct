    "output": "The key factor that contributed to the unprecedented HPD during the GFC was the large house-price bubble that inflated between 2003 and 2006, as evidenced by a research paper drawing on MSCI's house-price model. This differs from previous episodes of depreciation, such as that of the early 1990s in the Northeast and in Southern California, which were more localized and driven by unemployment. The exhibit below shows the relationship between the forward returns of a home-price index and an annualized historical return, identifying large and seemingly anomalous house-price increases. 2007 is identified as a housing bubble, with the model forecasting a nearly 0% four-year total index return. However, before the coronavirus shock, the same model identified a return forecast for 2019-2023 of 18%, pointing to a potentially milder depreciation for housing assets compared to the GFC.",

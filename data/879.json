    "instruction": "Please use our adaptive multi-factor framework to analyze and make a decision about tilting towards certain factors in the current market conditions, considering the macroeconomic environment, valuations, recent performance trends, and risk sentiment.",
    "output": "Based on our adaptive multi-factor model as of Sept. 30, 2020, we would recommend overweighting value, low size, and momentum factors. The macro-cycle pillar indicates an expansion, which supports overweighting value, low size, and momentum. The valuation pillar also overweighted value, low size, and yield, indicating the potential for value and low size to outperform. The momentum pillar selected momentum, quality, and low size, based on the last three months' relative performance, also supporting a tilt towards momentum. Finally, the market-sentiment pillar showed a risk-on environment, resulting in an overall mild overweight to momentum, value, and low size. Overall, we believe that a holistic approach that incorporates these factors could help optimize returns in the current market conditions.",

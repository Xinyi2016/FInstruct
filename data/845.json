    "output": "It seems that low volatility and dividend-yield factors have performed poorly due to investors shifting their positions towards higher beta stocks. However, the quality factor took a break and underperformed in June after beating the benchmark for eight straight months. Conversely, low size reversed and outperformed in June. As we consider investment decisions, it is important to keep in mind the impact of current market trends on different factors. For instance, a diversified portfolio including factors like quality and low size may help mitigate the risks associated with factors that are currently underperforming.",

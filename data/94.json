    "output": "The baseline model in this research is designed to investigate when an interest group can exploit ideological and affective polarization between political parties to its advantage. The model involves two ideologically polarized parties that hold opposite positions on an issue, such as relaxed versus tighter controls on carbon emissions. The interest group strictly favors one policy over the other and can credibly promise resources to legislators if they vote for its preferred policy. The party ideologically inclined towards the interest group's preferred policy is referred to as the \"favor\" party, while the other party is referred to as the \"against\" party.\n\nEach legislator derives resource-utility from the investment they receive from the interest group. However, legislators also suffer from an ideological-disutility if they vote against their party's ideologically preferred policy. The magnitude of this disutility serves as a measure of ideological polarization between the parties. The research question aims to investigate when the interest group can exploit this polarization to its advantage.",

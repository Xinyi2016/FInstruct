    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the historical performance of leveraged portfolios with a high concentration of bonds compared to a 60/40 portfolio.",
    "output": "Our analysis shows that leveraged portfolios with a high concentration of bonds performed well in comparison to a 60/40 portfolio during both the current year and the past 12 years. Bonds were sometimes even higher performing than the traditional low-volatility, low-return asset class. Therefore, despite significant deleveraging of assets in strategies with absolute volatility targets, this did not necessarily imply poor performance for these portfolios.",

    "instruction": "Please analyze the trends in historical growth in net operating income (NOI) from the MSCI U.S. Quarterly Property Index and compare it to a measure of transaction-implied income growth.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we found that transaction-implied income growth has historically tracked quite closely with actual NOI growth. However, we have noticed a growing disconnect between these two metrics in recent quarters. This suggests that our expectations may not be as well grounded as we had once believed and that we need to reevaluate our approach to evaluating performance going forward.",

    "instruction": "Can you summarize the deal activity for U.S. commercial property in the first quarter of 2023 and how it compares to long-term trends?",
    "output": "In the first quarter of 2023, sales across U.S. commercial property types fell 56% compared to the most active first quarter on record in 2022, totaling USD 85 billion. This drop could be viewed as a return to long-term averages after a period of excess liquidity, rather than a sign of a calamitous market downturn ahead. Office sales in both central business districts and suburban locations were well down from the long-term trend, with CBD offices experiencing a 77% decrease in deal volume compared to the average. Retail property sales were 19% higher in the first quarter than the pre-pandemic average, primarily due to a one-time entity-level deal.",

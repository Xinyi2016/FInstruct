    "output": "Table 3 presents descriptive statistics of Spanish exporters of products that were targeted by tariffs and the matched exporters. The number of exporters affected by tariffs was 1,216. Wine was the most important product for 78% of the exporters hit by a tariff in the US, while olive oil, cheese, and olives were also important products for some exporters. The overall export revenue of the tariff-targeted exporters was smaller than that of matched exporters, and the matched firms exported to more destinations and products than the tariff-targeted firms. Interestingly, the importance of the US market in total exports for the firms that were hit by tariffs was larger than for the matches.",

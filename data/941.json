    "instruction": "Please provide an analysis of the impact of current policies supporting student-loan borrowers on default rates for federal-student-loan ABS and private-student-loan ABS. Also, discuss the potential consequences of these policies expiring.",
    "output": "The current policies supporting student-loan borrowers, including the COVID forbearance period and stimulus checks, have had a significant impact on default rates for both federal-student-loan ABS and private-student-loan ABS. The default rates have dropped to half their pre-pandemic level. The relief policy has helped borrowers stay current with their student debt and created a six-month bump in forbearance for student-loan ABS. However, we have seen a rise in deferment, indicating that certain borrowers are still seeking ways of pushing back their repayments.\n\nIf these policies supporting student-loan borrowers expire, debtors may not prioritize repayment of their student loans, which could lead to an increase in default rates. Therefore, it is crucial to continue these support policies to help borrowers manage their student debt during these unprecedented times.",

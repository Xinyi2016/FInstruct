    "output": "Based on our analysis, there are three potential drivers of U.S. housing prices. The first factor is the unemployment rate, which has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. With an estimated 32% unemployment rate and 47 million layoffs, the demand for housing may lessen and result in lower housing prices. The second factor is investments subject to mortgage credit, which have historically been sensitive to future house-price trajectory. Based on TRACE data and MSCI\u2019s model for credit-risk-transfer (CRT) securities issued by Fannie and Freddie, the tranches spread widened by around 600 basis points amid the general credit-spread widening across riskier assets. This suggests that investors may be more cautious about investing in mortgage credit, which could in turn affect the housing market. The third and final factor is general credit-spread widening across riskier assets, which may affect the availability of credit for potential home buyers. These three factors combined may result in a potential decrease in U.S. housing prices.",

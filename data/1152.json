    "instruction": "Please determine the estimated beta of private infrastructure relative to a hypothetical MAC portfolio that is 50% invested in equity, 40% in government bonds, and 10% in private infrastructure, using the information provided in the exhibit.",
    "output": "According to the exhibit, there are three different estimates for the beta of private infrastructure relative to a hypothetical MAC portfolio with 50% equity, 40% government bonds, and 10% private infrastructure. The smoothed-valuation view and the public-bond proxy view both estimate the beta to be around 0.1-0.2, indicating a low level of risk and return required from the private-infrastructure portfolio. However, the MSCI model estimates the beta to be 0.6, which is still relatively low compared to listed infrastructure (1.3), but higher than the other two views. Ultimately, the estimated beta of private infrastructure will depend on the specific approach used and the investor's risk and return preferences.",

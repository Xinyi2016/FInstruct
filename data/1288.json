    "output": "I have analyzed the exhibit below which shows the potential impact of two scenarios on various asset classes. In the stagflationary scenario, both equities and Treasury bonds could suffer as slowing growth coincides with rising prices. This is in contrast to the 2008 global financial crisis where U.S. Treasury bonds acted as a cushion to offset losses in equity markets during demand-driven growth slowdowns. The stress test framework used by MSCI propagated the main assumptions to all other risk factors impacting portfolio returns, helping us assess the potential impact on multi-asset-class portfolios. \n\n[Insert exhibit image here]",

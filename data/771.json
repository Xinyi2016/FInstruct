    "instruction": "Please provide an analysis of how to strike a balance between market coverage and investability considerations in a methodology for a broad equity market benchmark.",
    "output": "Our analysis has shown that when carefully incorporated into a methodology, both market coverage and investability considerations can be balanced effectively. By comparing the MSCI GIMI methodology with other hypothetical methodologies, we have found ways to ensure that a broad equity market benchmark has a large market representation while remaining investible. However, it is important to note that the future of TOPIX methodology remains a subject of debate and further research is required to refine the balance between market coverage and investability.",

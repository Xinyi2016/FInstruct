    "output": "During a period of financial distress, significant market moves can have a significant impact on a bank's portfolio. For example, during the period following March 2020, interest rates dropped and funding spreads increased drastically. If a bank has many corporate clients entering into similar types of swaps, the bank's portfolio can become unbalanced. When interest rates drop, these swaps can move deeply into the money (ITM), which means the current value of the swap is positive. This can result in the bank needing to post more collateral on the hedge in the interbank market, while not receiving any collateral from the corporate. The funding requirement on this collateral, combined with exploding funding spreads, can explain the significant losses banks reported following the March 2020 events. The loss sizes depend on the bank's portfolio composition, valuation methods, counterparty creditworthiness, and the bank's funding risk. The market turmoil and corresponding losses had a significant impact on the derivatives business.",

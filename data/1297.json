    "output": "Based on our study and analysis, high-quality growth stocks have significantly outpaced their low-quality counterparts in both the U.S. and emerging markets from late 2021 to present. This reinforces our earlier findings on the resilience of higher-quality firms, as high-quality growth stocks have historically performed better during periods of market stress. Additionally, with rising costs, higher-quality firms may be better positioned to pass on these costs to their customers. Therefore, we recommend considering a focus on high-quality growth stocks in both the U.S. and emerging markets for potential investment opportunities.",

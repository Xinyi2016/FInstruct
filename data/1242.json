    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the improvements in resilience that were achieved as a result of integrating ESG into the core sleeve.",
    "output": "The integration of ESG in the core sleeve led to significant improvements in resilience to long-term ESG risks across each of the risk profiles. This was measured by an improvement in both ESG scores and ratings, with the ratings improving from A to AA. The climate-first model portfolios were able to achieve these improvements, which is a testament to the effectiveness of integrating ESG considerations into investment strategies. Overall, the improved resilience will help to mitigate potential ESG risks and ensure a more sustainable investment approach moving forward.",

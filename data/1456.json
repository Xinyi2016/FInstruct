    "instruction": "Can you provide an overview of the performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes from 2013 to 2021 and how it performed in the first three quarters of 2022?",
    "output": "The MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes outperformed on an annual basis for most years between 2013 and 2021. However, it underperformed during the first three quarters of 2022 due to reductions in industry contributions and exclusions from the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index. Despite allocations to carbon-efficient companies within each sector contributing to performance. In previous research, it was noted that the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes fared relatively better during years when the MSCI ACWI Index had negative returns and generally outperformed during years when global markets had positive returns. However, this year has been a struggle for the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes and the MSCI ACWI Index.",

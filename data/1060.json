    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the MSCI Global Environment Index and the Fossil Fuels Index, including their composition and adjustment frequency.",
    "output": "The MSCI Global Environment Index is composed of at least 50% of companies with revenue derived from alternative energy, energy efficiency, green building, pollution prevention, and/or sustainable water solutions. The index is adjusted quarterly based on market capitalization. The Fossil Fuels Index, on the other hand, is composed of at least 50% of companies with revenue derived from coal mining, fossil fuel power generation, and/or conventional and unconventional oil and gas exploration and production. Like the Global Environment Index, the Fossil Fuels Index is also adjusted quarterly based on market capitalization. As of December 2013, both the Green and Fossil Fuels Index had approximately 160 stocks each. However, as of May 2020, the Green Index included 216 companies while the Fossil Fuels Index had 208 companies. It is worth noting that the Green Index reached 200 stocks about four years earlier than the Fossil Fuels Index, indicating a faster transition to \"green\" investments globally.",

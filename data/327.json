    "output": "Superlinear scaling refers to a phenomenon where the environmental impact of companies grows at an increasing pace as they become larger. This is in contrast to sublinear scaling, where the environmental impact increases at a slower pace as companies grow. Superlinearity has been observed in several industries, including airlines, oil & gas, and independent power producers. One possible explanation for superlinear scaling is economies of scale, where large companies are able to lower the price of their product or service as production increases, leading to a higher environmental footprint. Another hypothesis is the role of subsidies for fossil fuels and energy-intensive industries. The sub or superlinear nature of scaling is important for setting emissions and environment targets for corporations, as companies with a higher impact than expected by their size may be facilitated or hindered in aligning their environmental-climate and economic-financial targets. The extent of potential reductions in environmental impact can be determined by enforcing a sector-specific, size-dependent benchmark. However, it is assumed that all companies with values above the benchmark can comply with the benchmark value. The spatial embedding of corporations, or the differences in national regulations or local economic and geographical determinants, can also affect the feasibility of enforcing such a benchmark.",

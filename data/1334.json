    "output": "After analyzing the income exposure across tenant types, concentration risk to individual tenants, and the probability of default on rental payments for the properties in the MSCI Pan-European Quarterly Property Fund Index (PEPFI), we found that there is a significant variation in income returns across different tenant types. The highest income returns were observed for properties with government tenants, followed by properties with blue-chip corporate tenants. The concentration risk to individual tenants was found to be relatively low, with no tenant accounting for more than 10% of the rental income. However, there is a risk of default on rental payments, with a few properties exhibiting a high probability of default. We recommend that investors consider tenant diversification and conduct thorough due diligence on their tenants' financial health to mitigate this risk.",

    "output": "Based on analysis of the CFTC Traders in Financial Futures data for the second quarter of 2023, we have found that market participants have returned to pre-crisis levels of net long and short positions on futures linked to the MSCI EAFE and MSCI EM Indexes. This suggests that traders have adapted to changing market conditions and have effectively managed their risk exposures using short and long futures, as well as options positions. The use of multi-country, multi-currency futures has proven useful for risk management, benchmark tracking, efficient market access, and liquidity management purposes, allowing investors to leverage pockets of liquidity and execute larger orders during specific trading sessions.",

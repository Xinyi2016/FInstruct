    "output": "Measuring cross-sectional volatility and its decomposition in terms of factors and specific components can greatly benefit our risk budgeting for both top-down and bottom-up asset allocations. Overall, for top-down asset allocation, style factors have offered greater opportunities for alpha than industries and countries. For bottom-up stock pickers, emerging markets have shown more potential for opportunity than developed markets. With the recent intense rotations in global equity markets, it has become even more critical for active managers to pay attention to cross-sectional volatility as it represents the opportunity set for outperformance.",

    "output": "Based on our analysis using the MSCI Integrated Model, we have found that there has been a significant decline in the volatility of both interest rates and inflation in the US bond market from 2010 to 2018. Specifically, the 10-year nominal yield volatility has fallen from 114 bps per year to 48 bps per year, while 10-year inflation volatility has declined even further to only 22 bps per year. This decline in volatility can be attributed to a number of factors, including a more stable macroeconomic environment, the alignment of expected and realized inflation, and the Fed's credibility with the market. However, it should be noted that while the current economic environment is favorable, there are still significant uncertainties that could result in future interest rate and inflation volatility. Therefore, investors may want to consider whether the market is underestimating these risks and take appropriate precautions.",

    "output": "While the industrial sector may continue to attract attention in the current economic climate, investors need to exercise caution when underwriting income-growth expectations. With inflation remaining stubbornly persistent and the Federal Reserve aggressively tightening monetary policy, an economic slowdown or recession could put downward pressure on market rents. Additionally, retail is facing headwinds from online shopping, and the office sector is contending with uncertainty over remote work. These factors all contribute to potential downside risks, which investors need to carefully consider before investing in the industrial sector.",

    "instruction": "Explain the impact of the intervention by the Compound community on the protocol\u2019s utilization and borrowing rate.",
    "output": "The intervention by the Compound community ensured that the protocol\u2019s utilization remained relatively low, i.e., it never exceeded 35%. As a consequence, the borrowing rate also remained relatively low. The intervention helped prevent mass liquidation as the borrowing rate never exceeded 10%. The amount of bad debt on Compound did not increase significantly in the lead-up to the merge, indicating that the increased rates ahead of the merge did not impact the protocol\u2019s health significantly.",

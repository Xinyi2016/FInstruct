    "instruction": "Can you provide examples of the sectors that have been impacted positively or negatively by a flip in control in midterm-election outcomes?",
    "output": "According to our study of 11 midterm-election outcomes since 1978, a flip in control of either or both chambers of Congress has not resulted in a significant drawdown relative to pre-election performance of the broader U.S. equity market. However, certain sectors have been impacted differently. For example, a flip in control has historically resulted in a negative performance for healthcare and a positive performance for energy. On the other hand, a status quo election outcome has typically resulted in positive performance for both healthcare and consumer discretionary sectors. It's important to note that our research only takes a unidimensional view of the impact of election outcomes on market performance and does not account for other external factors that may have influenced these outcomes.",

    "output": "The decline in biodiversity could have a significant impact on the availability and cost of medicines, as many important medicines are sourced from nature. With the loss of at least one important medicine every two years, healthcare costs could substantially increase, which may impact life and health insurers. It is important for insurers to consider how biodiversity decline may affect the risk landscape for life and health insurance and to develop strategies to address these risks.",

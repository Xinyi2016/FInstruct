    "instruction": "Research and identify the companies listed in the MSCI ACWI Index that have sustained board diversity, including at least three women directors for at least three years.",
    "output": "Based on the study findings, only 547 (19.0%) of the MSCI ACWI Index constituents have sustained a critical mass of female directors for at least three years. However, these companies are notable for their stronger ESG profiles and better environmental practices, including stronger records of reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, one-third of these companies were overall MSCI ESG Ratings leaders - twice the percentage of companies that lacked sustained diversity on their boards. As social inequality gains prominence, stakeholders are increasingly vocal about the need for greater diversity in corporate boardrooms. Identifying companies that have exhibited an ability to sustain board diversity, particularly given the challenges faced by women in the current COVID-19 pandemic, seems particularly salient.",

    "output": "Global investors in bonds and equities may respond to concerns about deglobalization by taking a more nuanced approach to asset allocation. This could involve considering new, more focused country allocations for broad allocation decisions, such as geopolitical blocs, energy importers versus exporters, or autocracies versus democracies. Furthermore, greater emphasis may be placed on risk factors exposed by events such as the war in Ukraine, including sanctions risk, reputational considerations, and currency convertibility. By adopting this approach, investors can mitigate the potential impact of desynchronized business cycles, wider variations in performance, lower correlations, and higher volatilities across countries.",

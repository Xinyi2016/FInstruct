    "output": "Normalizing emissions based on economic output or capital structure is a recommended approach to assess the emission profile of an index. This allows for a more accurate comparison of emissions between companies of different sizes and industries. By dividing total emissions by economic output or using EVIC, we can better understand the emissions efficiency of each company in the index. This method also helps to identify companies that may be emitting more than their peers in relation to their economic productivity. Adopting this approach can help promote sustainable investment practices and reduce carbon risk in portfolios.",

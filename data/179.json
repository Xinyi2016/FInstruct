    "output": "The text discusses several influential works on the topic of asset bubbles, including the theoretical model by Abreu and Brunnermeier, which offers insight into the persistence of bubbles in the presence of rational arbitrageurs. Sotes-Paladino and Zapatero use a dynamic trading model to show that sophisticated money managers can invest in overvalued assets. The Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, also known as the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, characterizes bubbles by faster-than-exponential growth of price with a finite singularity point. However, these models do not directly link the growth of the bubble to the inflow of traders or take advantage of large-population features. The present paper is the first to look into optimal bubble riding in a stochastic, non-cooperative, continuous-time game perspective. The significance of these findings is that they provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of asset bubbles and how they can be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of rational arbitrageurs and the actions of sophisticated money managers.",

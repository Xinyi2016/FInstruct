    "instruction": "Explain the concept of \"capital accumulation patterns\" and how they can vary between sectors.",
    "output": "Capital accumulation patterns refer to the distribution of capital across different sectors in an economy. These patterns can vary depending on the relative attractiveness of each sector and its neighbors, as well as constraints such as the requirement for high expected long-term returns to drive massive inflows of capital. As a result, there is an infinite number of possible capital accumulation patterns that can exist between sectors, ranging from relatively homogeneous levels of capital to highly heterogeneous patterns. Changes in parameters or expectations can cause these patterns to switch, inducing variations in average capital and sector-specific patterns of capital accumulation.",

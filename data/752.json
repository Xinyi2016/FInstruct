    "instruction": "Evaluate the potential impact of mortgage and housing relief programs on U.S. housing market prices during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "output": "According to MSCI's housing-price model, the U.S. housing market could experience relatively mild house-price depreciation (HPD) of 5% to 10% during the COVID-19 pandemic if there are early and broad mortgage- and housing-relief policy responses. The absence of a housing-price bubble and moderate mortgage- and consumer-debt levels also contribute to this potential outcome. While the economic shocks caused by the pandemic could be compared to the 2008 global financial crisis, the current situation is projected to have less of a downturn than during the GFC. However, it should be noted that the outcome remains uncertain and depends on the effectiveness of the relief programs implemented.",

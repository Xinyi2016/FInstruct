    "output": "To shift a multi-asset-class portfolio toward climate-change considerations, we used MSCI climate indexes as market proxies and simulated a building-block approach. This gradual approach involved moving the portfolio from a broad market-based approach to one based on climate-change considerations. Through our simulation, we found that this approach resulted in moderate levels of relative risk. Overall, this approach allowed us to shift our portfolio towards sustainable investments while still managing risk effectively.",

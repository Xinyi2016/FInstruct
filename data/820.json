    "output": "The \"media effect\" refers to how media coverage of declining mortgage rates can influence prepayment behavior. The AI model was able to capture this complex behavior because mortgages with higher coupons tend to prepay faster due to their higher refinance incentives. However, when rates reach historical lows and a larger segment of the mortgage universe becomes refinanceable, newer and lower-coupon mortgages respond to refinancing incentives much more quickly and reach much higher prepayment speeds than mortgages with higher coupons. This phenomenon is caused by complex dynamics between borrowers and mortgage originators. The AI model was able to forecast this more accurately than our human model.",

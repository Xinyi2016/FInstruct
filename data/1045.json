    "instruction": "Please analyze the diversity data points we collected for the past four fiscal years (2017-2020) and identify any trends or patterns within the broad thematic categories.",
    "output": "After analyzing the diversity data points collected over the past four fiscal years, it is apparent that there has been an overall increase in diversity across all broad thematic categories. However, there are some notable variations in the demographic and workforce groups reported by companies, as well as the geographies used when reporting diversity data. For example, the technology sector tended to have a higher percentage of male employees compared to other industries, while the healthcare sector reported higher percentages of employees from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, companies located in urban areas tended to have more diverse workforces than those in more rural areas. Overall, these trends provide valuable insight into the current state of workplace diversity and highlight areas where companies need to focus their efforts.",

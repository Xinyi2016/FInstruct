    "output": "Price impact, volatility, and bid-ask spreads are interrelated concepts in financial markets. According to Hasbrouck (1991), price impact is associated with wide spreads, meaning that when the price of an asset changes, it leads to a widening of the bid-ask spread. Engle (2000) also found that higher bid-ask spreads predict rising volatility, suggesting that the spread is a measure of the market's uncertainty about the asset's true value. Amihud (1987) observed that the greater the spread, the greater the close-to-close return variance, implying that assets with wider spreads are more volatile. Amihud (1986) suggested that higher-spread assets yield higher expected returns, with the market-observed average returns being an increasing function of the spread. Goodhart (1997) observed that a positive association between volatility and the spread would normally be expected, with positive correlation between volatility and spread and the main direction of causality running from volatility to spread. Bollerslev (1994) also found that spreads rise as volatility increases, showing a strong positive relationship between volatility and spreads. Overall, the relationship between price impact, volatility, and bid-ask spreads is complex and multidirectional, with each factor influencing the other.",

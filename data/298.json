    "output": "The credit cycle and the business cycle are closely intertwined, with the former playing a crucial role in shaping the latter. The credit cycle refers to the fluctuations in credit availability and demand over time, while the business cycle refers to the fluctuations in economic activity. The credit cycle is influenced by monetary and macroprudential policies, as well as by the behavior of banks.\n\nOne of the key challenges in modeling the credit cycle is capturing credit overshooting behavior by banks. This refers to the tendency of banks to expand credit creation beyond what is warranted by economic fundamentals, leading to a buildup of debt and increasing the risk of a financial crisis. The Mak(h)ro_0 model, for example, simulates asset-price-related demand-induced inflation, but it does not incorporate a price-wage spiral, which limits its ability to capture credit overshooting behavior.\n\nOther models, such as those developed by Caiani et al./Schasfoort et al., van der Hoog, and Krug, also have limitations in capturing credit overshooting behavior. For example, these models do not clarify how banks exploit and expand credit creation potential with quasi-automated fractional refinancing and circumvent capital adequacy and liquidity requirements.\n\nOverall, it is important to incorporate credit overshooting behavior by banks in models of the credit cycle in order to better understand the dynamics of the business cycle and to develop more effective policies to mitigate the risk of financial crises.",

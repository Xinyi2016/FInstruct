    "instruction": "Please analyze the exhibit and provide insights on the USD flows of globally listed exchange-traded products (ETPs) from August 2020 to August 2021.",
    "output": "According to the exhibit, yield-factor ETPs experienced the largest year-to-date inflows at around USD 30 billion later in the period. There was also a pickup in flow for quality ETPs in the last two months. These trends suggest that investors are increasingly interested in ETPs that prioritize income and quality. It should be noted that the flows of other ETP categories also fluctuated throughout the period, with some experiencing outflows while others saw moderate inflows. Overall, the exhibit shows that the ETP market remains dynamic and influenced by various factors such as economic trends and investor sentiment.",

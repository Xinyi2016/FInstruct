    "instruction": "Can you please explain the concept of reversionary potential and how it relates to the disparity between actual NOI growth and transaction-implied income growth?",
    "output": "Reversionary potential refers to the theoretical increase in income that could be achieved if in-place rents were adjusted to match current market rates. The growing disparity between in-place and market-based industrial rents is the primary reason for the disconnect between actual NOI growth and transaction-implied income growth. According to data from MSCI's US IRIS benchmark, there has been a significant increase in reversionary potential over the past 12 months, indicating that market rents have increased significantly faster than in-place rents. As a result, properties that are being sold based on transaction-implied income may not accurately reflect the actual potential for income growth.",

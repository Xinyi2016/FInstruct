    "output": "Upon analyzing the MSCI USA Small Cap Index using a U.S. equity risk model, it was determined that while the index has high exposure to the size factor (-2.17 as of Nov. 9), it also has non-negligible active exposures to several other risk style factors. Therefore, it can be concluded that there were other factors at play besides the size factor that drove the performance differential.",

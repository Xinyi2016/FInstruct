    "output": "Including Scope 3 emissions in a company's net-zero plan is crucial as it covers supply-chain emissions and emissions that result from the use of the company's products. Scope 3 emissions measure a company's success in shifting its portfolio towards cleaner products, and failure to address these emissions could risk the company's relevance in the market. To address Scope 3 emissions, companies may require their suppliers to have credible decarbonization plans or tie interest rates on loans to climate-transition targets for businesses they finance. Managing Scope 3 emissions effectively requires a granular understanding of the carbon footprint of individual companies and even products, leading to a paradigm shift in carbon accounting and standards. Companies like Daimler AG and Microsoft have already taken steps to address Scope 3 emissions through their net-zero plans and internal carbon tax, creating powerful incentives for suppliers to reduce emissions and steer funds into innovation.",

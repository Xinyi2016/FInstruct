    "instruction": "Analyze the charts below that apply distribution slicing to U.S. industrial assets and determine the factors that drove differences between the best- and worst-performing assets.",
    "output": "Upon analyzing the charts, it is apparent that the best-performing industrial assets had higher returns, lower volatility, and were more evenly distributed across deciles. Additionally, the best-performing assets had lower default rates and were characterized by higher market capitalization and a greater number of employees. Conversely, the worst-performing industrial assets had higher default rates, lower market capitalization, and were concentrated in the lower deciles. Overall, the analysis suggests that market capitalization, employee count, default rates, and distribution across deciles are key factors in understanding the differences between the best- and worst-performing industrial assets in the U.S. market.",

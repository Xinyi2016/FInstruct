    "output": "The study derives a closed-form expression for the degree of Relative Risk Aversion (RRA) of investors for non-\"fair\" lotteries, using only three variables: Treasury yields, returns, and market capitalization of a specific market index. The formula is tested on four market indices (CAC 40, EURO, S&P 500, and STOXX 600) for different time periods, and it is found that investors in these markets exhibit Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion (DARA) across all time periods. The degree of RRA is observed to change over time, varying between being constant, decreasing, or increasing. Additionally, the study proposes a simple and intuitive method to measure the effect of a wrong assumption about the utility function of an investor on the structure of their portfolio, using a two-asset portfolio framework. The empirical findings indicate that the weight invested in the risky asset varies significantly, even among utility functions with similar characteristics.",

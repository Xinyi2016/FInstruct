    "output": "To identify potential market dislocations during turbulent market environments, as an investor, I can use index-level prices and fundamental data to assess market segments such as geographies, market-cap size, and sectors. Currency-hedged indexes can also help identify potential dislocations in a strategic currency-overlay policy. Moreover, during heightened volatility, indexes with up-to-date constituent composition can assist in identifying potential dislocations in global and regional equity markets, as well as different market segments, including sectors and market capitalization.",

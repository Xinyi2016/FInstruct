    "output": "The text discusses the clustering of transactions in IBM transaction data and the presence of large autocorrelations in the time intervals between trades. The authors observe that the clustering occurs due to both informed traders and liquidity traders when spreads are small. They calculate the autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations in the waiting times between events and find that the autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations are far from zero and all signs are positive. The Ljung-Box statistic is used to examine the null hypothesis that the first 15 autocorrelations are 0, which is rejected. The positive autocorrelations generally start at a low value and decay slowly, indicating that persistence is an important issue when analyzing trade durations. The authors also observe that long sets of positive autocorrelations are similar to autocorrelations of squared returns, indicating that volatility clustering and duration clustering exhibit similarities.",

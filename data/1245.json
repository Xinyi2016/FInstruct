    "output": "To incorporate an investor's preference for investing in companies with good ESG and climate resiliency, we suggest allocating 50% of the core sleeve to ESG mandates and 50% to climate mandates. This allocation can be achieved by moving away from an allocation based solely on market capitalization and investing in companies that not only have good financial performance but also prioritize ESG and climate factors. Additionally, we recommend creating an impact sleeve consisting of assets that reflect the investor's specific climate and green solutions preferences. This will provide the client with the opportunity to invest in companies that align with their particular values and beliefs.",

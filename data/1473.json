    "output": "The historical return correlation between the U.S. and China from January 2012 to September 2022 was about 46%, which was below the average correlation of markets in the MSCI World Index during the same period. One of the reasons for this relatively low historical correlation was the differences in the policy objectives and growth drivers of these two economies. Additionally, the economies and equity markets of the two countries were in different stages of development. The exhibit shows that the MSCI USA Index had higher exposure to the information technology and health care sectors, while MSCI China and China A were dominated by consumer discretionary, communication services, industrials, consumer staples and materials. This indicates that the two markets had different sector exposures, which could have contributed to the differences in their historical returns. Furthermore, the U.S. market provided exposure to newly-emerged themes that were missing in China, such as blockchain and cybersecurity. Therefore, the thematic differences between the two markets could also be a reason for the relatively low historical correlation.",

    "output": "Our analysis examined the transition risk of investment-grade corporate-bond benchmarks and portfolios under a climate-policy scenario designed to restrict the increase in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C. According to our findings, the broader investment-grade corporate market, as reflected by market-capitalization-weighted benchmarks, suffered a potentially significant negative impact under our assumed climate scenario. However, we constructed hypothetical portfolios that generated small gains in potential value in this scenario without introducing significant tracking-error risk versus the portfolios' benchmarks. The transition to a low-carbon economy may impact stock and bond prices, presenting investors with potential risk and opportunity, should there be changes in public policy and investor-driven climate initiatives.",

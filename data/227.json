    "output": "The eigenvalues of the Hessian matrices have a close relationship with the model loss. The largest eigenvalue, known as \"sharpness,\" is a measure of the local curvature of the loss landscape. An increase in the sharpness value indicates a more complex data distribution, while a decrease indicates a simpler distribution. The eigenvalues also represent the complexity of the data and are tightly connected to the data, model, training procedures, and other variables. The change in the sharpness value can be used to examine the Edge of Stability (EOS) phenomenon and divide the dynamics of loss into four phases. The Hessian can have fundamentally distinct spectral behaviors depending on the data attributes, model, and loss function.",

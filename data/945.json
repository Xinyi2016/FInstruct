    "instruction": "Can you provide details on the spread differential between U.S. and eurozone companies' debt?",
    "output": "According to our analysis, bonds issued by U.S. companies experienced larger spread differentials than those by eurozone companies. Following the peak of the COVID-19 crisis's impact on financial markets, U.S. companies' USD debt traded at spreads that were between 20 and 40 basis points tighter than the same company's debt in EUR. This indicates that demand was stronger for USD-denominated debt for U.S. companies. For eurozone companies, demand for their USD and EUR debt appears to have been more balanced, meaning that investors in eurozone companies' debt were more currency-neutral than investors in U.S.-company debt.",

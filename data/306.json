    "instruction": "Explain how exogeneous modifications in the parameters change collective states.",
    "output": "Any modification in expectations or structural changes in economic and/or monetary conditions may change expected returns and in turn the collective state. Unstable type-3 sectors are particularly sensitive to these changes in long-term growth, inflation, and interest rates. Higher expectations in these sectors attract investment, which in turn increase expectations. This creates a seemingly endless expected growth spiral until outlook flattens or deteriorates. On the other hand, type-1 and -2 sectors attract capital through dividends and expected returns. Under higher expectations, these sectors are relatively less attractive than nearby type-3 sector. They may nonetheless survive in the long-term provided their short-term returns and dividends are high enough. External shocks, inflation, and monetary policy impact expectations, reduce long-term investment, and either drive capital out of sectors 3 to sector-1 or -2, or favour other pattern-3 sectors.",

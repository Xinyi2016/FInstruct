    "output": "Since the 2008 financial crisis, central banks have implemented QE programs, in which they buy bonds and other assets to stimulate the global economy. The ECB, BOJ, and BOE have all participated in these programs, with the ECB being the largest buyer. The ECB's Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP) has had a significant impact on the market, tightening spreads on eligible bonds by more than 20 basis points, according to 53% of respondents to a recent investor survey. Lower-quality bonds have generated greater returns than those with low spreads. However, the market performance weakened during the second period of analysis, due in part to rising inflation and growing debate about the potential tapering of QE programs. Investors continue to debate the timing and degree to which central banks will reduce their QE programs, with the potential for spreads to widen if the tapering is faster than expected.",

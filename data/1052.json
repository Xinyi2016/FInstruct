    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of China's research and development (R&D) expenditures and their potential impact on investment risks.",
    "output": "China is rapidly emerging as a leader in various fields of technology, which could have significant implications for investors searching for risks in this powerful trend. R&D expenditure behind technological innovation is a key indicator to watch. As shown in the graph, China's overall R&D expenditure for 2018 was $463 billion, second only to the United States, but China's cumulative R&D expenditure growth rate over the past five years was 49%, which is 16% higher than South Korea, the second-highest growth rate globally. The strong growth in R&D expenditure is expected to continue in the coming years, as while China's R&D expenditure growth is fast, overall, it still accounts for a lower proportion of China's GDP than many other countries.",

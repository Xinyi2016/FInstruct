    "output": "Interest-rate curves play a crucial role in determining the valuation of MBS by affecting index-linked coupon calculation, the discount curve, mortgage-rate projections, and swaption-volatility surfaces. The index-linked coupon calculation is straightforward and is based on a formula specified in the securitization's prospectus. The discount curve serves as a benchmark for investors to calculate the option-adjusted spread. Mortgage-rate projections rely on the rate curve, current-coupon spread, and primary-secondary spread, with steeper curves yielding higher future mortgage rates. Swaption-volatility surfaces generate future rate paths for the above three cases and require calibration and may experience inconsistencies. SOFR and LIBOR curves differ mainly by a spread term structure, which has minimal impact on the forward prepayment projection. The volatility surface between SOFR and LIBOR is also minimal, though SOFR rates are typically lower, leading to higher SOFR option-adjusted spreads due to the discount-curve effect. However, the impact on key risk measures is minimal, which bodes well for a smoother SOFR transition.",

    "output": "To develop a mathematical model for the Stackelberg game, we need to define the payoffs for each party and the strategies they can choose. We can start by defining the payoffs for each party as follows:\n\n* Payoff for the reinsurer: The reinsurer's payoff is the difference between the benchmark portfolio value and the insurer's portfolio value, multiplied by the reinsurance price.\n* Payoff for the insurer: The insurer's payoff is the difference between the benchmark portfolio value and the insurer's portfolio value, multiplied by the reinsurance price, minus the reinsurance premium paid to the reinsurer.\n\nNext, we need to define the strategies that each party can choose. The reinsurer can choose the reinsurance price, and the insurer can choose the reinsurance strategy (the amount of risk transferred to the reinsurer).\n\nThe Stackelberg equilibrium is the solution to the game where each party chooses the optimal strategy given the other party's strategy. In our case, the reinsurer moves first and chooses its strategy knowing the optimal response of the insurer. Afterwards, the insurer selects its strategy knowing the optimal strategy of the reinsurer.\n\nTo find the Stackelberg equilibrium, we can use a method such as backward induction. We start by solving the insurer's problem given the reinsurer's strategy, and then we solve the reinsurer's problem given the insurer's strategy. The Stackelberg equilibrium is the pair of strategies that maximizes the total terminal wealth for both parties.\n\nIn summary, the mathematical model for the Stackelberg game in our problem considers the payoffs and strategies of each party and finds the optimal strategies that maximize the total terminal wealth for both parties.",

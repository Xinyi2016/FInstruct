Measure the active return and active risk between the original and modified fund for the period from January 2008 to March 2018, aiming to stay below 150 bps of active risk between the modified and original fund.",
    "output": "We have used the MSCI Factor Classification Standard (FaCS) to modify a sample of U.S. small-cap value mutual funds by targeting a FaCS Quality exposure 0.20 higher and FaCS Volatility exposure 0.20 lower than the original fund. We have measured the active return and active risk between the original and modified fund for the period from January 2008 to March 2018, aiming to stay below 150 bps of active risk between the modified and original fund. The results have been mixed, with returns generally improving when modifying quality with active risk below the threshold, while we were less successful in modifying volatility with returns improving in only four out of 29 funds. Overall, we were able to modify the funds without introducing unintended factor tilts and with only a slight reweighting of stocks, showing the potential for MSCI FaCS to help active managers differentiate themselves.",

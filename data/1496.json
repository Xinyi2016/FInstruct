    "output": "Based on my research, agricultural production, specifically the cultivation of crops like palm oil, soybeans, beef, and timber, has been a major driver of tree-cover loss in biodiversity-rich tropics. This is because the demand for these commodities has led to the expansion of agricultural lands into forested areas, resulting in deforestation and habitat loss. However, it is important to note that some companies and organizations have implemented sustainable practices and certification programs to minimize the impact of agricultural production on the environment.",

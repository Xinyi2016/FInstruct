    "instruction": "Please analyze the exhibit and provide an explanation for the recent year-to-date performance in global bond markets.",
    "output": "The exhibit shows a sustained bond-market rally over the year-to-date period, which has likely contributed to the performance we have observed. While rates momentum has been important historically, the current rally in global bond markets may have a stronger impact on performance due to the low yield environment and investors' search for yield. Additionally, uncertainty around the global economy and geopolitical risks may be driving demand for safe-haven assets, such as bonds.",

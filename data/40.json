    "output": "The dendrogram is a tree-like structure that represents the hierarchical relationships between different portfolios based on their similarities and differences. In this case, the dendrogram exhibits three primary subclusters and a small outlier cluster. The primary subclusters are groups of portfolios that share similar characteristics, while the outlier cluster consists of portfolios that are distinct from the other clusters.",

    "output": "Making special contributions during market downturns can actually have multiple benefits for a pension fund. One of the main advantages is that it allows the fund to invest at beneficial times. In our Stagflation scenario, the annualized return on special contributions was higher than the average return over the full period. This means that investing during market downturns can lead to higher returns in the long run. Additionally, making special contributions immediately after a shortfall arises can help the fund to stay on track and meet its obligations to beneficiaries. Overall, the discipline to make special contributions during periods of market uncertainty can be a smart strategy for pension funds looking to maximize returns and ensure long-term financial stability.",

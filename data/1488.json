    "output": "While swapping coal and oil for natural gas may seem like the most practical option for power companies, there are other viable alternatives to consider. For example, companies can invest in renewable energy sources like wind or solar power which can effectively reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the long run. Additionally, investing in energy-efficient technologies and implementing energy-saving practices can also make a significant impact on reducing emissions. Lastly, promoting sustainable energy practices to consumers and encouraging them to reduce their energy consumption can help contribute to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.",

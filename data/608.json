    "instruction": "Please evaluate the pros and cons of switching from a holdings-based asset-allocation approach to a factor-based approach in terms of risk contribution.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, the holdings-based approach has resulted in greater fluctuations in risk contributions than expected. However, the factor-based approach is designed to target a stable risk contribution by adjusting asset-class weights in response to regime changes. Therefore, switching to a factor-based approach may result in more stable risk contributions, but it may also require more frequent adjustments to asset-class weights. It's important to weigh the potential benefits of stability against the cost of additional adjustments when considering switching to a factor-based approach.",

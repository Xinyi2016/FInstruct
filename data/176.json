    "output": "The analysis makes several clarifying assumptions to allow for the presentation of suggestive reduced form evidence on the importance of the channel being studied. The purpose of the analysis is not to provide precise estimates of biases due to local labor market conditions, but rather to introduce and discuss the issue. The analysis uses decennial Census data for the years 1980, 1990, and 2000 and finds evidence that both agglomeration and signaling externalities are of similar magnitudes, with the important feature that concentrating skills has a heterogeneous impact across locations through the signaling externality. The effect of a more even distribution of skills across locations is convex in the initial skill concentration across locations, with MSAs with low skill levels before redistribution experiencing large positive gains relative to initially high skill MSAs which experience small losses. Overall, this suggests that policies affecting the distribution of skills across space should consider not just the impact on productivity, but also on how the local labor market will impact skill acquisition more broadly.",

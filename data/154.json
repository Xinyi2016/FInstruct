    "output": "Recent meta-analyses of the economic impact of climate change have been updated with more data, revealing three new results and confirming two previous findings. The central estimate of the economic impact of global warming is always negative, indicating that climate change has a detrimental effect on the economy. The confidence interval about the estimates is much wider, suggesting a higher degree of uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact. Elicitation methods, which rely on expert judgment, tend to produce more pessimistic estimates, while econometric studies, which use statistical models, are more optimistic.\n\nTwo previous results remain: the uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises, meaning that the potential consequences of climate change may be worse than anticipated; and poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones, with the economic impact of climate change being disproportionately felt by developing nations.\n\nA meta-analysis of the impact of weather shocks on economic growth has revealed that studies that relate economic growth to temperature levels cannot agree on the sign of the impact, while studies that make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. This suggests that the impact of climate change on economic growth is not well understood and may depend on how it is measured.\n\nThe impact on economic growth implied by studies of the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon, which is the economic damage caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions, shows a similar pattern to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of moderate warming in the near and medium term. Overall, the updated meta-analyses confirm that climate change has a negative economic impact, but the magnitude and duration of the impact remain uncertain and subject to debate.",

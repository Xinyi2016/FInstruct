    "instruction": "Please analyze and compare the thematic exposure of the \"Base,\" \"Barbell,\" \"Aggressive,\" and \"Risk Reducing\" portfolio combinations while controlling for the other outcomes found above.",
    "output": "After exploring the three possible combinations that increase thematic exposure while controlling for the other outcomes found above, we found that the \"Barbell\" approach funds the thematic allocation from exactly half the growth allocation, resulting in a moderate exposure to themes. The \"Aggressive\" approach fully funds the thematic allocation from the growth allocation, resulting in high exposure to themes. Lastly, the \"Risk Reducing\" approach funds the thematic allocation from growth and introduces a low-volatility allocation funded from core, resulting in a balanced exposure to themes and low volatility. Based on these findings, we suggest analyzing which approach aligns best with your investment goals and risk tolerance.",

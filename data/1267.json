    "instruction": "Write a response defending the use of advisory say-on-climate votes as a tool for shareholder activism.",
    "output": "While some critics argue that shareholders already have the ability to hold boards accountable for climate inaction by voting against individual directors responsible for a company's climate strategy, this approach may not always be effective. Say-on-climate votes provide an additional tool for shareholders to express their dissent without risking the disruption associated with a failed director election. Furthermore, these votes allow for escalation, meaning that directors who ignore a low say-on-climate result could be targeted in the future. Ultimately, say-on-climate votes are a valuable mechanism for shareholder activism and can help drive real change in corporate approaches to climate risk.",

    "instruction": "Can you explain the findings of the study regarding the trade-offs in including microcaps in investable equity universes in Japan and the U.S. using the MSCI Investable Market Index and the MSCI All Cap Index?",
    "output": "Sure, the study found that the trade-off between low-size premium and liquidity was more significant in Japan. However, considering liquidity and size together actually improved investability. The MSCI Japan IMI had a better liquidity and tradability profile than hypothetical indexes with the same number of constituents selected solely on size, which suggests that including microcaps in investable equity universes in Japan may be beneficial. The study used the MSCI Investable Market Index and the MSCI All Cap Index as proxies for the investable universe and total-market universe, respectively, and examined the trade-offs in terms of including microcaps in Japan and the U.S., which are two of the major sources of these stocks.",

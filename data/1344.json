    "output": "In exploring how wildfire risks may change in the future, we considered satellite data, climate-model projections, and socioeconomic factors such as wildfire management. Based on our analysis, we found that most assets of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index constituents were located in regions with low to medium wildfire probability in 2050, primarily because assets were primarily located in urban areas which tend to have a lower wildfire probability than other types of land use. However, we also found four future hotspot regions with annual fire probabilities above 1% in parts of Central America/Brazil, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia.",

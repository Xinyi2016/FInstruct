    "output": "To develop an abstract model that yields valid and meaningful explanations about certain phenomena, we need to follow a methodology that has been successfully used in the past in many fields of science, including economics and agent-based modeling. This methodology involves building an abstraction of the real world, the model, that generates synthetic data, the model generated data output, through simulations. The validity of the model is then evaluated by comparing the simulated data to empirical observations of the \"real world\". The degree of approximation to the \"real world\" is evaluated by comparing the simulated data to empirical observations of the \"real world\". Contrary to the indirect calibration approach, we do not attempt to calibrate the model. The validation of the model is independent of any particular ethical position or normative judgments. The validation is objective and deals with \"what is\", the empirically observed facts, and not with \"what ought to be\". Only the empirical evidence reveals whether or not this abstraction of reality, our model, has a meaningful empirical counterpart.",

    "output": "One key difference in how supervisors view financial service companies' balance sheets is the assumption of either a static or dynamic balance sheet. Some supervisors, such as the Bank of England, Bank of Canada, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority, assume a static balance sheet where the size, composition, and risk profile do not vary over the stress testing time horizon. In contrast, several other jurisdictions use a hybrid approach, assuming a dynamic balance sheet for certain long-term horizons. \n\nIn terms of climate risk assessment, there are differences in the types of risks that supervisors focus on. The Bank of Canada primarily tests for transition risks, while others, including the European Central Bank, Bank of England, Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de Resolution, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority focus on both transition and physical risks. These differences may make it challenging for investors to compare the full suite of climate-related risks faced by all institutions.",

    "output": "To address the challenges posed by the scarcity and bias of incident datasets in mixed migration settings, a methodology that incorporates multiple data sources and triangulates information can be developed. This methodology should involve the following steps:\n\n1. Identify and gather all available datasets on incident-level data on crossings, including reports from NGOs, government agencies, and other relevant sources.\n2. Assess the quality and reliability of each dataset, taking into account factors such as bias, completeness, and accuracy.\n3. Develop a system for combining and integrating the different datasets, taking into account their strengths and limitations.\n4. Apply statistical and computational methods to analyze the combined dataset, with the goal of identifying patterns and trends in smuggler strategy and the evolution of crossings.\n5. Validate the findings through comparison with other sources of information, such as interviews with migrants and smugglers, and ground truth observations.\n6. Communicate the results in a clear and transparent manner, highlighting the limitations and uncertainties of the analysis.\n\nBy following this methodology, it is possible to develop a more comprehensive understanding of incident-level data on crossings in mixed migration settings, despite the challenges posed by biased and limited datasets. This can help to inform policy and practice related to migration and border control, and ultimately improve the safety and well-being of migrants.",

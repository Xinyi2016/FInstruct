    "output": "Sure. GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. were among the top-10 companies by weight multiple in the aggregated hedge-fund short portfolio. Their weight multiples increased significantly in 2020 due to the pandemic and hedge funds increasing their short positions. GameStop\u2019s weight multiple was around 30 in January 2020 and reached 60 in August, while AMC\u2019s weight multiple was low until August 2020 when it started to increase dramatically. These shorts had a large effect on the market earlier this year.",

    "output": "As an investor, analyzing the composition of corporate boards can provide valuable insight into a company's potential for success. A board with a balanced level of relevant skills and experiences can play a central role in helping firms address the current complex market environment. Climate-savvy directors could help a company pursue its ambitions to be a responsible corporate citizen and address investors' growing focus on the environment. Adding more women in the boardroom could improve gender diversity and potentially contribute to better human-capital management. Introducing a younger cohort of directors could help support decision-making by bringing a wider range of views and experiences to board discussions. By considering these factors, investors can more accurately assess a company's potential for long-term success.",

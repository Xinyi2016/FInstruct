    "instruction": "Please summarize the main factors that contributed to the outperformance of our ESG indexes during the recent coronavirus crisis, and explain how our methodology played a role in minimizing industry-specific risks.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis of the exhibits above, the outperformance of our ESG indexes during the coronavirus crisis was largely due to equity style tilts, with ESG being the strongest contributor. These tilts included lower beta, lower volatility, and better quality. Additionally, our methodology for constructing the indexes aimed to reduce differences from the parent index in sector exposures, which helped reduce the contribution from industry factors. Overall, the positive contribution from the ESG factor during the crisis supports our belief that ESG considerations can help mitigate risks from exogenous shocks.",

    "output": "The potential for economic loss from the biodiversity crisis is increasing the need for insurers to better assess related risks. By combining biodiversity-screening metrics with MSCI's assessment of companies' risk management practices and controversy data, insurers can identify biodiversity risks more effectively. For instance, among companies assessed on the key issue of biodiversity and land use, 13% of the companies with physical assets in sensitive areas had weak risk management practices due to the lack of adequate policies and programs. Additionally, 35 companies faced severe or very severe biodiversity and land use controversies. By incorporating this information, insurers can engage with high-risk companies, address regulatory and reporting pressures, and apply exclusion-based underwriting. This approach can thus help insurers properly price risks associated with biodiversity-related topics across multiple key issues, ultimately leading to more effective insurance underwriting.",

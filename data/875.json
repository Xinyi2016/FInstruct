    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of the adaptive multi-factor model and identify which factors it is overweight and underweight on.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, the adaptive multi-factor model showed a mild overweight to momentum and value, meaning that these factors are likely to perform well according to the model. However, it also showed a mild underweight to yield and quality, indicating that these factors may not perform as well. Additionally, the model had a large overweight to low size, meaning that it favors investing in smaller companies, and a large underweight to low volatility, which suggests that it avoids investing in highly volatile stocks.",

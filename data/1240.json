    "instruction": "Please explain why the impact portfolio outperformed the market-cap portfolio over the same period.",
    "output": "The impact portfolio outperformed the market-cap portfolio over the same period by an average of 130 bps across all risk profiles due to the choice to reallocate capital to companies that earn the bulk of their revenue from alternative energy or other sustainable businesses and away from fossil-fuel businesses. The added risk reflected the concentration of capital in a smaller set of companies that derived significant shares of revenue from green revenues. Both the core and impact allocations achieved their improvements with tracking error of less than 0.9% and 2.2%, respectively, and the risk profiles of both intensities remained in alignment with the hypothetical client's starting point. As clients seek to counter climate change and improve sustainability, managers may want more personalized approaches for constructing portfolios at their disposal. A climate-first approach can help wealth managers tailor strategies to match clients' unique preferences.",

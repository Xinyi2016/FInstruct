    "output": "The Ethereum blockchain fork faced several challenges, including the rise of DeFi and the prevalence of asset-backed tokens. The transition to PoS was complicated by the fact that many stablecoins and ERC20 tokens were asset-backed, meaning that they derived their value from underlying assets that were not necessarily on the same blockchain. This led to concerns about the value of these tokens on the ETHW chain, as they were no longer backed. Additionally, the organizations behind the biggest stablecoins, USDT and USDC, announced that they would support the transition to PoS, which further complicated matters.",

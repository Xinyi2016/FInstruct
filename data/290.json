    "output": "The Level-K model is a game-theoretic model used to study strategic thinking and decision making. In this model, players are assigned a level based on their sophistication in strategic thinking. The level represents the highest amount of money that the player is willing to request, with the assumption that the player will randomly choose a request within their strategy set.\n\nIn the example given in the text, there are 20 possible requests, ranging from $11 to $20. A level0 payer randomizes uniformly within their strategy set, while a level11{}_{1}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT player requests $20 and earns $20. A level11{}_{1}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 1 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT player who requests $19 earns $19 for sure and a $20 bonus with a probability of 1/10, for a total expected payoff of $21.161616. This creates a pattern where each level picks the request that is one less than the previous level's highest request, except for level1010{}_{10}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 10 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and level1111{}_{11}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 11 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, who both pick $20. This makes it difficult to infer a player's sophistication level based on their request.",

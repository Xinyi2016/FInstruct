    "instruction": "Please write a brief summary of the proposed SEC rule and its potential impact on liquidity classifications and disclosure requirements for funds.",
    "output": "The proposed SEC rule aims to standardize liquidity classifications assumptions and require public disclosure of funds' liquidity profiles, which may enhance investors' ability to assess fund liquidity. However, the proposed approach may lead to significantly different classifications for some sectors (e.g., high-yield and municipal bonds) and result in less liquidity differentiation within certain bond-market segments. Nonetheless, current rules' positive feature is they allow fund managers to use security-specific price-impact definitions to better understand changes in relative liquidity, which will still be relevant even if the proposed rules are adopted.",

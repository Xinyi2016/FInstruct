    "output": "By separating financials and real estate into their own sectors, investors are now able to analyze and evaluate these two distinct groups of companies separately. This allows for a more granular approach to investing, as each sector now contains companies with unique characteristics and performance metrics. Additionally, this separation has resulted in different historical returns for each sector, providing potential opportunities for investors to diversify their portfolios and maximize returns. For example, a real estate-focused investor may invest in companies within the real estate sector for stable income streams, while a financials-focused investor may invest in companies within the financials sector for potential growth opportunities. Ultimately, the evolution of the GICS standard has provided investors with greater flexibility and insight into the market, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions.",

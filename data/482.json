    "output": "In the related literature, there are a few exceptions to the typical assumption of independence. For instance, Tsetlin and Winkler (2005) study optimal decisions in a one-period expected utility framework in which the decision maker undertakes risky projects that are correlated with both additive and multiplicative background risks. They document the importance of the direction and degree of dependence between the project risk and the background risk, and prove that it may be optimal for a risk-averse agent to undertake a project with zero or even negative expected returns in the presence of an additive negatively correlated background risk. Franke et al. (2006) study a similar problem for multiplicative background risk, extending the results of Gollier and Pratt (1996) and finding conditions on preferences that lead to more cautious behavior. Franke et al. (2011) examine simultaneous effects of both additive and multiplicative risks on optimal portfolio choice. They rationalize certain paradoxical choice behavior in that context and show how background risks might lead to a seemingly U-shaped relative risk aversion for a representative investor.",

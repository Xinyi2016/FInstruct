    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed explanation of the task instruction and generate appropriate response based on the following: Two groups of agents, producers and investors, each represent the real economy and the financial markets, respectively. The first group is composed of a large number of firms in different sectors that collectively own the entire physical capital. The second group, investors, holds the entire financial capital and allocate it between firms across sectors according to investment preferences, expected returns, and stock prices variations on financial markets. In return, firms pay their investors dividends. Thus financial capital is a function of dividends and stocks\u2019 valuations, whereas physical capital is a function of the overall capital allocated by the financial sector. They are described by two different interacting fields and by the system action functional. The solutions to the minimization equations of the action functional are the background fields of the system. They characterize the collective states of the system, structure the interactions between the two types of agents, and condition individual dynamics. From a sector perspective, the collective states determine the capital average distribution and the firms\u2019 concentration within sectors, given external parameters, such as changes in expected returns, technological advances, as well as their dynamics when these external conditions evolve.",

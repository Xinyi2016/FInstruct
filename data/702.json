    "output": "To manage the risks associated with investing in emerging markets, a diversified approach is crucial. Instead of relying on a handful of local, country-by-country futures contracts, investors should consider using a mix of instruments such as ETFs, mutual funds, and futures contracts to achieve a diversified exposure to different countries and currencies within the EM universe. In addition, it's important to pay close attention to liquidity considerations, particularly during times of stress. While EM futures' liquidity has improved significantly, investors need to ensure that the instruments they use have sufficient liquidity to enable them to exit or enter positions quickly and efficiently, especially during volatile market conditions. Finally, keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments, central bank policies, and trade agreements can help investors to stay ahead of emerging risks and to adjust their strategies as needed based on changing market conditions.",

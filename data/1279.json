    "output": "After conducting research, I found three companies that offer index-linked climate derivatives to manage climate change risk. The first one is BlackRock, which has created a range of indexes that align with different climate metrics, including carbon intensity and temperature alignment. The second company is MSCI, which offers low-carbon indexes as well as a recently launched Climate Paris Agreement Aligned Index. The third company is S&P Global, which has created a suite of indices that measure the exposure of companies to climate risk and track the performance of low-carbon and renewable energy companies.",

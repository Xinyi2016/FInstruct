    "output": "Index-based strategies and ETFs played a critical role in facilitating price discovery, promoting market efficiency, and providing flexible tools for active portfolio management in a rapidly changing market environment. The large dispersion in performance across different segments and strategies during the crisis allowed investors to seek return enhancement and risk diversification opportunities, many of which could be implemented through ETFs and other index-tracking investment vehicles. These ETFs generally remained liquid and provided transparent and efficient ways for investors to implement their active asset allocation decisions during the crisis. Overall, index-based strategies and ETFs were essential in helping investors navigate the volatile market conditions during the crisis.",

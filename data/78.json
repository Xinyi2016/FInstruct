    "output": "Mixing refers to the process of redistributing wealth in an economy in such a way that the distribution becomes more even or homogeneous. In the context of wealth inequality, mixing is predicated on the existence of a transformation of wealth that has a steady-state distribution. The rescaled wealth is often used as a hypothesis for this transformation, but there is growing evidence that it may not be ergodic, meaning that it may not be mixing. If this is the case, then measures such as the relaxation time become undefined and mobility across the whole distribution is non-existent. However, another transformation of wealth may exist that is mixing, and measures in terms of it may suggest that there is mixing in the economy. Different concepts of economic mobility require different analytical approaches, and the relevant wealth transformation is important for policymakers to produce adequate measures for optimizing mobility within an economy.",

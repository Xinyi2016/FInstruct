    "instruction": "Can you explain the exhibit and what it indicates about growth and non-growth factors in terms of return contribution over time?",
    "output": "Sure, the exhibit shows that when exposure to non-growth factors was controlled, the contribution to return from these factors remained stable and consistent over time. However, growth continued to be the main contributor to return. In both periods, the contribution from non-growth factors was similar, suggesting that these factors did not significantly impact returns over time. This indicates the importance of focusing on growth factors for maximizing returns.",

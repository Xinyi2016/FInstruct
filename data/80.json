    "output": "The reallocation rate uniquely determines the relaxation time, whereas the noise amplitude has no effect on the total variational distance. However, the subsample size critically determines the behavior of the stable state in the system as it determines the value of the stationary total variational distance. This is because the estimation of the distance relies on the differences between the empirical distribution function (i.e. histogram), and the distribution function for the target stationary wealth distribution. Due to the subsample size always being a finite number, there will be differences between the empirical distribution and the target distribution, which will be translated in a positive total variational distance. As the subsample size increases, in the limit as the subsample size goes towards infinity, the differences will disappear.",

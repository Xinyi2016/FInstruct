    "output": "An example of a situation where patient selling may have benefited investors in the bond market is the case of U.S. regional banks' bonds. As per the report, timing proved crucial for investors who reduced their exposure to these bonds. Patient sellers who waited for liquidity conditions to improve may have avoided excessive transaction costs. A similar scenario was observed with Italian bonds during a period of political turmoil in 2018, where bid-offer spreads recovered while credit spreads remained high. Hence, not initially selling and waiting for liquidity conditions to improve may have proved beneficial for patient sellers in both cases.",

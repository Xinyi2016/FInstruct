    "output": "COVID-19 has already caused disruptions in global supply chains and decreased consumption which could lead to short-term decreases in GDP growth. A combination of supply and demand shocks could further impact growth in the short term. Additionally, if the crisis persists, it could result in long-lasting effects such as changes in global supply chains which could contribute to lower growth in the long term. This could have significant implications for future equity-market performance.",

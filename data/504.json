    "output": "The purpose of re-weighting and one-to-20 matched propensity score matching (PSM) in the study is to ensure that the control group is representative of the treatment group in terms of observable characteristics such as age and marital status. This is important because differences in these characteristics between the treatment and control groups could potentially bias the results of the study. By re-weighting the control group to match the distribution of observable characteristics in the treatment group, and by using one-to-20 matched propensity score matching to select similar households in the control group, the researchers aim to reduce the potential for bias in their results and increase the validity of their findings.",

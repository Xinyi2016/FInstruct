We analyze how interconnection with neighboring countries mitigates electricity storage requirements. First, we quantify the substitution effect between interconnection and storage, define several factors driving the decline in optimal storage capacities in a larger balancing area, and then quantify their importance. We differentiate between \u201cshort-duration\u201d storage, parameterized as lithium-ion batteries, and \u201clong-duration\u201d storage, parameterized as power-to-gas-to-power storage.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the electricity grid has increased significantly in recent years. However, the variability of RES poses a challenge to the stability of the grid. Geographical and temporal balancing are two approaches to address this challenge. Geographical balancing involves exchanging electricity with neighboring areas that have different weather and demand patterns, while temporal balancing involves using electricity storage to balance the supply and demand of electricity. From a techno-economic perspective, these two approaches are substitutes to a certain degree. Therefore, the need for storage capacities in a specific region decreases if electricity can be exchanged with neighboring areas that have different weather and demand patterns.\n\nMethodology:\nWe use a modeling approach to investigate the interactions between geographical and temporal balancing in a future 100% renewable energy scenario in central Europe. We consider several factors that drive the decline in optimal storage capacities in a larger balancing area, such as the size of the balancing area, the share of RES in the electricity mix, and the",

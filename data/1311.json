    "output": "Based on recent market data from the ChinaBond Green Bond Index and other benchmarks, one key driver of the outperformance of Chinese green bonds is the relatively better performance of credit spreads. In 2021, the credit spread of the ChinaBond Green Bond Index narrowed by 14 basis points, while the ChinaBond New Composite Index widened by 4 basis points. This indicates that investors have shown greater appetite for green bonds, which tend to offer higher environmental and social benefits and lower risk exposure. Other drivers of the performance of Chinese green bonds may include government policy support, investor demand, and the overall growth of the green finance sector in China.",

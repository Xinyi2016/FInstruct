    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the increase in the share of green bonds issued by governments and its impact on global green-bond indexes.",
    "output": "The expansion of the global green-bond market has led to a notable rise in the share of green bonds issued by governments, with sovereign green bonds now constituting over 20% of the Bloomberg MSCI Green Bond Index. This has consequences for the benchmark's profiles, with sovereign green bonds typically having a slightly higher duration compared to other green bonds. The rise of sovereign green debt has significantly changed the green-bond universe and the indexes that track it, requiring investors to adjust accordingly. Despite challenging fixed-income market conditions in 2022, there is still strong investor appetite for sovereign green bonds, with a growing number of countries issuing green debt.",

    "instruction": "Please explain the difference between voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) and compliance carbon markets (CCMs).",
    "output": "VCMs are unregulated markets where individuals, firms, governments, and nongovernmental organizations voluntarily buy carbon offsets from project developers to achieve carbon compensation and neutralization. On the other hand, CCMs are regulated markets, also known as emissions-trading systems, where regulators auction or distribute a limited number of carbon allowances to various regulated companies. Each allowance allows its owner to emit one ton of a pollutant such as CO2. Companies that are more efficient in their emission reductions can sell unused allowances to companies that need to purchase allowances for excess emissions. The goal of carbon markets is to internalize the cost of carbon and allow the market to optimally decide the usage of resources with a lever to reduce the overall supply of emission allowances gradually. The market size of VCMs is small, with approximately USD 1 billion of carbon offsets traded in 2021, while the market value of CCMs is approximately USD 270 billion globally, with some of the biggest systems being EU ETS, North America (WCI and RGGI), and U.K. ETS.",

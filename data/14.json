    "output": "The market for sovereign green bonds has evolved significantly since the first sovereign green bond was issued by Poland in 2016. More than 20 sovereign issuers, ranging from Germany to Chile, have joined course, indicating that more issuers have begun participating. Additionally, some governments have issued green bonds on a semi-regular basis, indicating that the issuance volume per issuer has increased. Governments have become noteworthy green-bond issuers, in part because of the state's unique role in spearheading climate-transition projects such as large-scale national infrastructure. Moreover, some sovereign issuers have explored sustainability-linked-bond structures in recent quarters, such as Uruguay.",

    "output": "According to the MSCI Pan-European Quarterly Property Fund Index, the constituents have greater exposure to industrial and retail property types in terms of remaining income, rather than by capital value. Out of the remaining income, 75% is contracted to tenants in the consumer-staples, consumer-discretionary, and industrial segments. Furthermore, 60% of the remaining income amounts are owed by companies with an INCANSTM Global Score above 75, indicating that they have a BBB- or higher investment grade rating. Given the high inflation rates in many markets and the potential for rising interest rates, it is crucial for investors, particularly those who leverage their investments, to evaluate the nature of their real estate income streams to ensure they can cover their interest-payment liabilities.",

    "output": "The expansion of the global green-bond market has seen a notable increase in the share of green bonds issued by governments, with sovereign green bonds now constituting over 20% of the Bloomberg MSCI Green Bond Index. This rise in the share of sovereign green bonds has consequences for the benchmark's profiles, as sovereign green bonds tend to have a slightly higher duration compared to other green bonds. The emergence of sovereign green debt as a financing vehicle for environmental development programs has significantly changed the green-bond universe and the indexes that track it. Sovereign green bonds offer investors a diverse range of project exposures, with proceeds used for conservation, biodiversity, and physical-risk adaptation. Despite more challenging conditions in fixed-income markets in 2022, there is still strong investor appetite for sovereign green bonds, with a growing number of countries issuing green debt. Overall, sovereigns have had a significant impact on the green-bond market, leading investors to adjust their investment strategies accordingly.",

    "instruction": "Please explain the relationship between MSCI's indices and ESG research, as well as the performance of their ESG indices compared to their respective mother indices in the past 6 years.",
    "output": "MSCI's indices are closely integrated with ESG research, with their ESG indices in both the emerging market and China outperforming their mother indices in terms of excess returns from 2013 to 2019. Additionally, these ESG indices also showed improvements in their risk-return ratios, with increased Sharpe ratios and lower maximum drawdowns. This is largely due to the growing recognition and acceptance of ESG principles by the public, attracting more funds to be allocated to ESG and driving its level up. As a result, increasing the allocation of high-rated ESG companies will reduce the occurrence of negative events and thus lower portfolio downside risk, leading to increased relative returns. Based on MSCI's historical data, ESG investment itself can effectively control risk and bring long-term profits. Consequently, MSCI continues to develop new ESG indices to cover different market opportunities and incorporates ESG as an independent factor in its global multi-factor model to drive portfolio risks and returns.",

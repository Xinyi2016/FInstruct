    "output": "The NGFS has developed a range of climate-change scenarios that capture various phenomena and project inflation and interest rates for the next 30 years. These scenarios include the \"Net-Zero 2050\" scenario, where U.S. inflation is projected to be higher initially and then decline steadily, and the \"Delayed Transition\" scenario, where the increase in inflation occurs later. Overall, in the green-transition scenarios modeled by the NGFS, inflation is expected to be higher than in the climate-agnostic baseline scenario for a period, although the timing might be different.",

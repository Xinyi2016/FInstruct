    "instruction": "Please explain why there were large variations in market performance during the crisis.",
    "output": "The market performance during the crisis varied greatly across different asset classes, market segments, regions, countries, sectors, industries, strategies, themes, and individual securities. This can be attributed to a rational and discriminating reaction by investors, with sharp drawdowns in economically sensitive factors and small drops or even rallies in safe-haven assets. These declines actually presented opportunities for active portfolio management, allowing investors to add value and generate returns. Overall, the market behavior during the crisis demonstrated a selective and calculated approach by investors, rather than a panicked or indiscriminate one.",

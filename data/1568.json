    "instruction": "Please explain the negative contribution of high ESG-rated stocks to MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index during the third quarter of 2022.",
    "output": "During the third quarter of 2022, the specific return contribution of various MSCI ACWI ESG indices to the specific return was significantly negative, and the impact was significant on MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index, which includes high ESG stocks from various sectors. The same Leaders Index excluded stocks due to continuous ESG controversies, which became a major factor in underperformance. As of September 30th, 2022, the inclusion of the top four stocks (Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.) in the MSCI ACWI Index accounted for over 12% of the same index, and half of the negative contribution to specific return on the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index can be explained by these exclusions. Both Apple and Amazon were excluded from the MSCI ACWI ESG Index due to their involvement in continuous controversies related to customers and governance. While companies like Microsoft and Alphabet were constituent stocks of the MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Index during the second quarter, they continued to underperform in the third quarter, dragging down the overall performance.",

    "output": "Our analysis shows that incorporating ESG criteria into a long-term investment portfolio can have a positive impact on performance and risk profile. ESG scores have positive correlations with size, quality, and low volatility, which can lead to improvements in risk-adjusted performance. When integrated into passive strategies, ESG generally improved risk-adjusted performance without negatively impacting the ability to capture market returns efficiently. Defensively oriented factor strategies, such as high quality and low volatility, would have benefited from incorporating ESG, while value strategies incurred a greater reduction in target factor exposure for similar ESG improvements. The impact of ESG on ex-ante information ratios of these strategies is relatively moderate and varies depending on the primary investment objective and target factors of the underlying strategy. Overall, incorporating ESG criteria may provide guidance to passive and active managers looking to enhance the ESG profile of their strategies.",

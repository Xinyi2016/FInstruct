    "instruction": "Analyze the interactive exhibit below and describe how the pure private return premia has varied over time for different private-capital strategies.",
    "output": "The pure private return premia, net of fees, for different private-capital strategies varied over time from Jan. 1, 2013, to Dec. 31, 2018, compared with the previous 26 years (Jan. 1, 1987, to Dec. 31, 2012). The exhibit shows that the pure private return premia for leveraged buyouts had a significant spike during the early 2000s but has since decreased. Real assets and private equity funds have shown a more consistent return premium over time. However, venture capital had a high variance in return premia, with some periods showing significant returns and other periods showing negative returns. These variations in return premia can be influenced by changes in supply and demand of private-market investment opportunities and the private-market cycle, as well as differences in companies\u2019 profiles, such as size and age.",

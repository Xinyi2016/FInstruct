    "instruction": "Please analyze the exhibit included in the passage and explain how the inclusion of Aramco impacted the sector composition of the MSCI Saudi Arabia Indexes.",
    "output": "The exhibit shows that prior to the inclusion of Aramco, the energy sector had a very low representation in the MSCI Saudi Arabia IMI, accounting for less than 1% of the index. However, with Aramco's inclusion, the energy sector's weight rose to 6.5%, which resulted in a closer alignment between the country's economy and the publicly listed investment universe. This demonstrates that the inclusion of Aramco had a significant impact on the sector composition of the MSCI Saudi Arabia Indexes by increasing the representation of the energy sector in the index.",

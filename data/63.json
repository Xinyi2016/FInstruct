    "output": "The critical level is a threshold that separates the exploration and consumption regions in resource management. It represents the minimum level of proven reserves required to sustain consumption at a given rate. When the proven reserves fall below the critical level, exploration must be initiated to discover new resources to maintain consumption at the same rate. The critical level is determined by the balance between the rate of consumption and the rate of discovery. The higher the rate of discovery, the lower the critical level. The critical level is also influenced by the level of uncertainty in the resource management process. When uncertainty is high, the critical level is lower, as it is more likely that no discoveries will be made, and exploration must be initiated earlier to maintain consumption. Conversely, when uncertainty is low, the critical level is higher, as it is less likely that no discoveries will be made, and exploration can be deferred until the proven reserves fall below the critical level.",

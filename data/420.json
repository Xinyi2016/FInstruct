    "output": "Gini importance vectors are high-dimensional representations of products, like word embeddings in natural language processing. They contain information about the productive background that the Random Forest algorithm recognizes as necessary or highly predictive for their future export. The distance between such vectors can be used as a proxy for products\u2019 similarity: two products whose Gini importance vectors are close need a similar presence/absence pattern of capabilities in order to be competitively exported. To test this hypothesis, the 97-dimensional vectors were projected on a 2-dimensional continuous space using the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-SNE. The resulting space, called Feature Importance Product Space (FIPS), is shown in Figure 2, where each dot represents a 6-digit product and the colors correspond to ten aggregate macro-categories. The structure of the FIPS is heterogeneous, with clusters of products belonging to single categories and regions with the superposition of different product categories. This differentiation can be traced back to the complexity of products making up different sectors: less sophisticated sectors tend to be more distinguishable, as they need few capabilities, and therefore share similarity patterns with a smaller set of other products. On the contrary, high-complexity products share large portions of the respective production lines and supply chains. To highlight the ability of the space to identify the similarity of products even if they originally belong to different productive categories, two small clusters were identified: the first groups products related to the fur manufacture, and the second puts together different typologies of products, all related to the spacecraft industry.",

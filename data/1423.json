    "instruction": "Analyze the performance of the MSCI ACWI climate indexes in the first half of 2022 compared to their historical performance and the performance of other MSCI ACWI indexes. Discuss the factors driving their underperformance and highlight differences in the approach of MSCI ACWI Climate Change and MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Indexes.",
    "output": "The MSCI ACWI climate indexes have underperformed the MSCI ACWI Index in the first half of 2022, mainly due to the outperformance of the energy sector and the rally in value stocks. However, the contribution from green-revenue companies helped to mitigate the underperformance. Historically, from November 29, 2013, to December 31, 2021, the MSCI ACWI Climate Change and MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Indexes outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index by 125 basis points (bps) on an annualized basis. On the other hand, the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders and MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Indexes performed in-line with the MSCI ACWI Index during the same period. While both the MSCI ACWI Climate Change and MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Indexes incorporate climate objectives, they do so differently, leading to varying levels of active share and tracking error. Institutional investors should consider these differences when selecting indexes to create investment products based on their objectives.",

    "output": "After comparing an allocation model with a U.S. home bias and one without using a moderately aggressive allocation of 60% equity and 40% fixed income, it was found that the home bias alone added over 70 basis points (bps) of active risk. This indicates that wealth advisers with a U.S. equity overweight could be exposed to additional source of equity risk, such as home-bias risk. The bias toward U.S. equities also introduced overweights to certain sectors and style factors, which were dwarfed by the country decisions' active risk. Historical home biases around the world showed that a U.S. bias had significant outperformance but with periods of sharp declines. During an extended period of drawdown in the U.S. home bias, the home-biased allocation model trailed the reference allocation model by 4% at its trough, with 100 bps of active risk comparable to the level of active risk highlighted in the exhibit. Thus, it is crucial for wealth advisers to consider the risk and return implications of a U.S. home bias in their allocation models to meet their clients' return objectives effectively.",

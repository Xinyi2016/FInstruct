    "instruction": "Summarize the key findings of the study on the productivity implications of R&D, capital accumulation, and innovation output for entrants and incumbents in Estonia.",
    "output": "The study found that while a small percentage of firms engage in formal R&D in Estonia, a larger percentage innovate. The impact of innovation output, which includes \u2018doing, using and interacting\u2019 (DUI) mode of innovation, is higher for entrants than incumbents. Entrants who innovate are 21% to 30% more productive than entrants who do not, while the corresponding figures for incumbents are 10% to 13%. Despite the adverse sectoral composition typical of catching-up economies, Estonian incumbents are comparable to their counterparts in developed economies in translating STI activities into productivity gains. Embodied technological change through capital accumulation is found to be more effective in generating productivity growth than R&D, but the effectiveness is higher for firms engaging in R&D. Finally, the study suggests that certain policy recommendations for spurring productivity growth in technologically advanced economies may not be applicable for catching-up economies.",

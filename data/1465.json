    "output": "According to our model, almost 30% of firms in the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index are at risk of significant heat damage under a \"Hothouse World\" scenario, which could lead to a loss of USD 4 trillion in economic value. The consumer staples, utilities, and energy industries are among the most vulnerable sectors, and these companies could see a quarter of their market value erased, with some even potentially going bankrupt. It is important to note that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, could reduce these losses by two-thirds, on average. Investors are increasingly aware of climate-related risks, and it is therefore crucial that companies take steps to address and mitigate these risks.",

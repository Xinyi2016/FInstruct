    "instruction": "Please analyze the performance of our growth and value funds compared to market-cap benchmarks as well as growth and value style indexes. Include an examination of the tracking error and the managers' tilts towards their target styles.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we found that growth funds have consistently outperformed their market-cap benchmarks over the past decade. On the other hand, value funds have underperformed in this same period. However, when we compared our analysis set of growth and value funds to growth and value style indexes, we discovered outperformance from managers of both styles. Moreover, we found that style indexes were more appropriate benchmarks for growth and value funds based on tracking error analysis. We also noted from the managers' tilts towards their target styles that this tilt can vary across managers and across time. This information can help us gain a better understanding of these exposures and their impact on the performance of these funds.",

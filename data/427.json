    "output": "The research shows that the positive response of stocks to good (i.e., higher growth) MNA surprise is stronger when monetary uncertainty is low. However, at a high enough level of monetary uncertainty, the relation between stock returns and MNA surprise may reverse due to the larger strength of the monetary channel. The research also finds that the stock response was likely negative in the 1980s due to a very large negative risk-free rate channel. The study suggests that the monetary channel and the risk-free rate channel are important factors in determining the reaction of aggregate stock prices to most types of MNA. After controlling for these channels, a 1 standard deviation surprise in major MNA causes 30 bps higher returns, which is equal to 90% of the standard deviation of returns during similar 30-minute periods on days without MNA. These findings have important implications for investors and policymakers, as they highlight the importance of monetary policy and uncertainty in shaping stock market dynamics.",

    "output": "If we examine the number of people by boat type, a more nuanced picture emerges. From Figure 3(c), we can see that prior to mid-2017, the declining number of passengers per boat is driven primarily by the falling size of wooden boats. This may be due to the decreasing availability of large boats, in part because many wooden boats were destroyed by Operation Sophia starting in 2015 (UK House of Lords, European Union Committee 2016). However, it may also result from the fact that rafts became an increasingly viable transport option during this period (since rafts are cheaper, and the growing intensity of rescue efforts made rescue more likely), thus decreasing the relative profitability of launching large wooden boats (which have very high fixed costs). If we examine rubber boats, we can find support for this hypothesis: Figure 3(b) shows that crowding on rubber boats increased through early 2017 while rescue capacity was high, before beginning to decline towards 2018 - 2019. Particularly interesting is the trend for the MSF rescues, which tend to occur within the Libyan SAR zone: we can see that crowding still remains higher for these NGO rescues than for other types of incidents. More generally, the fall in boat sizes is consistent with the notion that smugglers are currently using smaller, less crowded boats to move migrants further out to sea before detection, a hypothesis that we evaluate in more detail below.",

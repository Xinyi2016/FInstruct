    "output": "The central results indicate that the intensity of product market competition is a crucial factor in determining whether an RJV (Research Joint Venture) increases the probability of innovation. When competition is soft, meaning that the increase in industry profits from successful joint innovation is substantial relative to the benefit from escaping competition, the likelihood of innovation is higher under an RJV than under traditional R&D competition. This suggests that RJVs can be an effective means of promoting innovation, particularly in industries where product market competition is not overly fierce.\n\nMoreover, the results show that the existence of financial constraints and the presence of spillovers are not necessary for the positive effects of RJVs on innovation. This means that RJVs can be beneficial in a wide range of industries and market conditions, not just those with specific characteristics.\n\nOverall, the findings of the central results have important implications for firms considering RJVs as a means of enhancing their innovation capabilities. They suggest that RJVs can be a viable option for firms operating in industries with soft product market competition, and that the presence of financial constraints or spillovers is not a prerequisite for the success of such collaborations.",

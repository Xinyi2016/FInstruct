    "output": "On October 9, 2019, the US announced the products that were affected by an additional tariff. Specifically, 159 out of 405 potential products were affected by the additional tariff (39%). For all products, except for the aircraft industry, the additional tariff was set at 25%. The additional tariff for aircraft-related products was set at 10%. However, the tariff was increased to 15% in February 2020. These tariffs came into force on October 18, 2019. In June 2020, 30 more products were added to the potential list of targeted products. In September 2020 and January 2021, additional tariffs were applied on 8 and 13 more products, respectively. In March 2020, the tariff was lifted from one product (prune juice) and applied to another product (butchers\u2019 or kitchen chopping or mincing knives). 138 out of the 180 products targeted by tariffs were primary products or manufactures of primary products, such as cheese, fruits and nuts, olive oil, olives, wine, and liquors. The remaining 42 products were manufactures, such as aircrafts, printed pictures, or sweaters. Finally, in March 2021, the US and the EU agreed to suspend the tariffs for 4 months. The temporary suspension was widened to a 5-year period in June 2021. The US government reached a similar agreement with the UK, which had already left the EU\u2019s single market and customs union at the beginning of January 2021.",

    "output": "A company relying solely on hydroelectric power for operations could face significant risks and potential financial losses due to extreme weather events caused by climate change. If temperatures rise above 5\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels, the company may lose its market value if the river it depends on to generate power falls below a certain water level. Based on MSCI's physical climate risk model, over a quarter of companies in the ACWI Investable Market Index could face significant heat risks, with around 2,900 companies at risk from all weather extremes. It is important for companies to consider climate change in their risk management strategies and plan for potential disruptions to their operations.",

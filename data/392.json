    "output": "Tighter budget constraints faced by traders in the market due to the liquidity factor of the LMSR (Fig 3a) lead to weaker price movements as traders are unable to push prices as strongly towards levels that reflect their beliefs. This results in price adjustments becoming a noisy estimate of the difference between a trader\u2019s belief and market beliefs, leading to errors in variables when estimated via ordinary least squares. The Total Least Squares estimation method is used to address this error in variables, which is different from the traditional one encountered in econometrics and cannot be treated through the common instrumental variables approach.",

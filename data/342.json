    "output": "In Figure 9, the evolution of two measures is illustrated over an increasing number of axes: the number of balls and the number of balls without any connections to other balls. The number of balls curve is much steeper than the number of balls without any connections curve, and the latter is close to 0 at 20 axes but then hits 500 around 40 axes. Declining ball sizes are also in line with expectations.\n\nThe total connections and average connections measures display notable hump shapes, with the connectivity rising as the increasing axis numbers split up the original large balls. Once the largest ball sizes start to approach the smallest, the peak of the hump is passed, and total connections fall. Average connections in panel (f) can be seen to fall first, with the peak being around 18 axes versus 22 for the total connection number.\n\nThe impact of the number of axes on the measures is evident, with the use of 5, 10, and 20 axes for the example plots indicated in Figure 9 as vertical dotted lines. The narrow confidence intervals resulting from 10,000 repetitions indicate that the shape of the BM graph is indeed affected by the changes in numbers of axes, rather than any variation at a given number of axes.",

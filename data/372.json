    "instruction": "Summarize the main points of the passage.",
    "output": "The passage discusses five studies that examined behavioral scientists' predictions in behavioral science experiments. The goals of these studies were to test methods for aggregating predictions, compare subgroups of behavioral scientists, and compare behavioral scientists to non-scientists and scientists in other domains. However, the studies did not compare the behavioral scientists' predictions to simple benchmarks or heuristics. The authors argue that such comparisons are critical because simple models often perform at least as well as experts in other domains.",

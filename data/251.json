    "output": "Table 3 notes to which exchange(s) funds were transferred by each borrower. Further, we indicate whether the borrower transferred the funds to exchanges before (on the Ethereum blockchain) and/or after (on the EthereumPoW blockchain) the merge. Any transfer to exchanges before the merge was ETH as opposed to ETHW, but some exchanges announced ahead of time that they would give the users ETHW for the ETH held with them. We further indicate in Table 3 whether the funds transferred to exchanges amounted to at least 50% and/or 99% of the debt taken on by the address ahead of the merge. Most addresses, especially if we disregard the smart contracts where our method does not identify transfers to exchanges, transferred at least half of their new debt to exchanges. While we cannot determine the exact purpose of these transactions, it is highly likely that they intended to sell ETHW. Interestingly, the wallet with the highest debt increase ahead of the merge belonged to the now infamous Alameda Research: the cryptocurrency trading firm that allegedly traded FTX customer funds and lost them. Subsequently, leading to the bankruptcy of FTX in November 2022. We also want to highlight that we tracked 49206 ETH(W) to exchanges from only the borrowers shown in Table 3 \u2013 more than 49% of the ETH debt on Compound (100\u2019000 ETH) ahead of the merge. At the time of the merge, the transferred ETHW was worth more than 2 Mio US$. Note that while borrowers did have to pay interest, these expenses were far lower than the value of ETHW, as is shown in Appendix B (cf. Figure 14).",

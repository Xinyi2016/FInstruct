    "output": "Nasdaq's mandatory disclosure rules will bring about a much-needed change to increase diversity on boards. These rules will enable investors to hold companies accountable for their lack of diverse directors, which has not been possible through voluntary disclosure. With annual disclosure aligned with EEOC definitions, investors will have a consistent and comparable measure to assess board diversity over time and relative to peers. By implementing these quotas, Nasdaq is creating a level playing field and a baseline for diversity in companies listed on their exchange. This is a crucial step towards creating a more representative boardroom, which can lead to better decision-making, innovation, and long-term growth for companies. Investors can use these diversity data to engage with companies and convince boards to rethink their director recruitment strategies. With more investors turning to engagement as a catalyst for change, these mandatory disclosure rules can be a major driver to increase diversity on boards and create a more inclusive corporate culture.",

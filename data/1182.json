    "output": "According to the panelists, as an investor, you have leverage and are an important stakeholder in pushing for real change and cleaner energy in companies. Divestment may not solve the problem, as the assets still emit emissions even if you wash your hands of the problem. Instead, panelists urged investors to focus on improvement in harder-to-abate sectors and to engage with companies to make changes. The recent success in electing three new dissident directors to push for cleaner energy at Exxon Mobil is an example of how investors can use their influence to effect change and support bold choices from companies.",

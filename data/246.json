    "output": "The article \"Risk Theory in Insurance and Finance\" discusses the use of risk theory in the insurance and finance industries. It explains how different risks can affect multiple lines of business at the same time and how statistical dependence among claims should be taken into account. The article also explores the insurer-reinsurer model, which is used to model two branches of the same insurance company and the ruin occurs if one or both companies go bankrupt. The article provides examples of simple ruin probability formulas for the insurer-reinsurer model, including one based on a random bipartite network. The article also discusses a model driven by a general spectrally positive or negative L\u00e9vy process.",

    "output": "Credit default swaps (CDS) are financial derivatives that provide protection against credit risk, or the risk that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. In essence, a CDS is a contract between two parties, where one party (the protection buyer) pays a regular premium to the other party (the protection seller) in exchange for protection against a credit event, such as a default or bankruptcy, on a specific asset or group of assets.\n\nThe protection seller agrees to compensate the protection buyer in the event of a credit event, up to a certain amount. In return, the protection buyer agrees to make regular premium payments to the protection seller, even if no credit event occurs.\n\nCDS are widely used in the financial markets as a way to manage credit risk. For example, a bond investor may purchase a CDS on the issuer of the bond, in order to protect against the risk of default. Similarly, a bank may purchase a CDS on a company it lends to, in order to protect against the risk of default on the loan.\n\nCDS are also used for speculative purposes, where investors may purchase CDS on companies they believe are at risk of default, in the hope of making a profit if a credit event occurs.\n\nOverall, CDS are an important tool for managing credit risk in the financial markets, and have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their standardization and ease of implementation.",

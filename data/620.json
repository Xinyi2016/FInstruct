    "instruction": "Please analyze the risk of flooding in Central London and Greater London based on the information provided above.",
    "output": "Based on the information provided above, it can be observed that Greater London is somewhat less exposed to flooding than Central London due to the Thames Barrier system, which is the world's second-largest movable flood-defense system. The Thames Barrier can provide a flood defense as tall as an eight-story building and protect 1.3 million people and billions of pounds in property value. The map below shows that the largest concentrations of assets in Central London closest to the Thames itself are at low to very low risk of flooding. In contrast, the postcodes with most assets at risk tend to be located closest to the Thames\u2019 tributaries in less central areas of Greater London.",

    "output": "The size of equity markets in emerging markets and Asia has seen significant growth since the end of 2004. The professionally managed asset pool targeting the region has also increased substantially. Subregional and single-market returns in EM and Asia have sometimes been sizable and played a historic role in driving stock performance. Futures contracts based on regional and single-market indexes have been used by some investors to complement their investment process in the region. The aggregate free-float market capitalization of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI Pacific ex Japan Index has grown from a weight of 8.5% at the end of 2004 to 15.4% as of June 30, 2020, reflecting increased business productivity and dynamism in the region. Expectations for future economic and financial-market growth in the EM and Asia have also contributed to the rise in market size.",

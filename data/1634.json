    "output": "The proportional increase in sovereign issues in the Bloomberg MSCI Green Bond Index has led to a significant impact on its risk and return profile. One of the major impacts has been the higher average effective duration of sovereign green bonds compared to other issuer types. This has resulted in a higher level of risk, as the longer duration makes bonds more sensitive to changes in interest rates. On the other hand, the higher duration has also resulted in higher returns for investors. Overall, the impact of the proportional increase in sovereign issues on the index's risk and return profile is significant, and investors would be well-advised to take this into account when making investment decisions.",

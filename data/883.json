    "output": "Since 2017, there has been a noticeable trend of more purchase expenditure migrating to locations outside of main U.S. global cities. While these large metros have historically provided superior capital growth, sustained yield compression has made them more expensive than other markets. As COVID-19 plays out, it remains to be seen how this trend will be impacted. However, focusing on shifts below the headline figure may help in assessing the impact of the pandemic on prime office markets. It is likely that global gateway cities will be more significantly impacted by the pandemic than their less expensive counterparts, as they may face challenges in attracting and retaining tenants due to high costs. Ultimately, it is important for investors to adopt a more nuanced city strategy during times of crisis in order to maximize their returns and mitigate risks.",

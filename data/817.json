    "instruction": "Use the MSCI AI agency prepayment model and compare its results with the production model that was built using traditional modeling techniques.",
    "output": "The MSCI AI agency prepayment model proved to be more accurate in its forecasts than the traditional production model across historical periods and risk factors, indicating the potential benefit of using artificial intelligence techniques in prepayment risk modeling for mortgage-backed securities. However, to avoid model risk, it is important for AI modelers and users to test the model\u2019s risk-factor sensitivities against economic intuition.",

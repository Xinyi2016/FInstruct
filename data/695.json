Consider the historic performance of these strategies, as well as their potential risks and benefits. Identify which developed sovereign-bond markets have the largest positive and negative momentum exposures.",
    "output": "Based on my research, systematic government-bond strategies tilted toward momentum have performed well year to date. However, it's important to note that momentum has historically had long periods of strong performance before falling sharply, so both bears and bulls could have reason for caution. \n\nIn terms of developed sovereign-bond markets with the largest positive momentum exposures, Australia, Israel, and the U.S. are currently leading the way. On the other hand, Japan, Switzerland, and Norway have the most negative exposure.\n\nI've found that momentum strategies, which are based on the view that the trend in an asset's returns will continue, have been employed by equity and commodity investors for decades. There is also a growing body of literature that suggests the momentum effect exists in other asset classes, particularly in developed-market sovereign rates. Trend-following strategies have produced consistent positive premia in bond markets, just as they have for equities and commodities, with lower overall levels of return and volatility. However, it's important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of implementing these strategies in your investment portfolio.",

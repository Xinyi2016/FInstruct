    "output": "Yes, our analysis shows that discretionary managers can enhance their strategies by incorporating factor information while preserving their fundamental investment process and the added value from security selection. We suggest using reweighting of existing portfolio holdings as a method of introducing factors without substantially modifying the existing discretionary portfolio. By increasing the weight of holdings with above-average factor exposures and decreasing the weight of stocks with below-average exposures, portfolio managers can introduce a modest tilt towards rewarded factors across the portfolio. Our analysis indicates that adding factors to a universe of active portfolios led to improved performance historically, with the manager's stock selection contribution remaining largely unchanged after the integration of factors. This means that tilting portfolios towards rewarded factors can add value to active returns without compromising a manager's ability to generate alpha from security selection.",

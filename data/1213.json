    "instruction": "Analyze the impact of supply and demand dynamics in the market for fossil fuels on movements in green leader/laggard spreads.",
    "output": "The movements in green leader/laggard spreads can be influenced by changes in the price of oil, as evidenced by the environmental premium spiking during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis coinciding with the plunge in oil prices. Environmental laggards tend to benefit from increases in oil prices and suffer when prices decline. The recent 50% increase in oil prices may have supported current spreads on laggards and counteracted the potential effects of climate change and climate policy. Therefore, investors should closely monitor the interplay between energy-price dynamics, climate change, and climate policy using green spreads as a new metric for measuring the trend in leader/laggard spreads.",

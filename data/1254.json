    "output": "To manage climate-transition risk in a credit portfolio, there are two approaches: using a decarbonization target as a constraint or a weighting scheme based on securities' climate profiles. Both approaches require careful consideration of tractability, turnover, and trading cost to minimize the impact on portfolio performance. \n\nThe first approach involves imposing a minimum level of decarbonization as a constraint on the portfolio selection process. This involves achieving financial targets while capping emissions or any other measure of transition risk at the portfolio level. Metrics measuring transition risk and decarbonization targets must be carefully defined to ensure consistency with the investment universe's emission profile and allow for a feasible investable universe. \n\nThe second approach involves tilting portfolios towards constituents with better climate profiles using summary statistics like Climate Value-at-Risk, Low Carbon Transition Scores, or Implied Temperature Rise. While this approach is more flexible and tractable, it cannot guarantee a decarbonization path. \n\nGiven that energy, utilities, and materials sectors contribute over two-thirds of global emissions and score the highest carbon intensity, both approaches can achieve a certain level of decarbonization by underweighting these sectors and high-emitters in other sectors. However, the adequacy of such an approach depends on sustainability and financial targets and the investors' investment philosophy. \n\nUltimately, portfolio managers must carefully define metrics and constraints and consider tractability, turnover, and trading costs to develop a plan to manage climate-transition risk effectively.",

    "instruction": "Analyze and report on the diversification benefits of private capital despite lower correlations to public-market groups.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we found that all 17 private capital strategies had significantly lower correlations to equivalent public-market groups. Despite this, nine had correlations below 60% and all 17 correlations were below 75%. However, these correlations were still substantially lower than those for the same asset class in public equities. Despite the lower correlations, the diversification benefits of private capital remained intact. This suggests that private capital can continue to provide diversification benefits regardless of the return premia.",

    "output": "Based on the analysis of MSCI China All Shares Themes Index performance, it has been found that regulatory changes have a deeper and more significant impact on social and lifestyle themes than on themes related to technological innovation. Historical crowding data reveals that investment themes such as future transportation and efficient energy have shown relatively high levels of crowding since the beginning of the year. The recent regulatory changes in China have raised questions among investors, particularly those focused on long-term, structural, and transformative investment themes. However, overall, these changes align with China's latest development agenda, the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" (2021-2025), which emphasizes sustainable growth goals such as social welfare, safety, equality, and green development. In this context, the recent regulatory changes are aligned with the long-term development goal of improving social welfare in China.",

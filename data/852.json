    "instruction": "Please analyze the potential decline in the portfolio's value due to climate risks and opportunities, and provide a breakdown of the contribution of transition risks and physical risks. Also, identify the industries and regions that are most affected by climate risks.",
    "output": "Based on the aggregated Climate VaR, we found that the potential decline in the portfolio's value due to climate risks and opportunities is -7.75%, with the breakdown between transition risks (-0.59%) and physical risks (-7.16%). The policy risks heavily contributed to the portfolio's transition risks (-4.43%), but they were mostly offset by transition opportunities (+3.83%). On the physical-risk side, coastal flooding and extreme heat were the significant contributors to the downside risks (-6.15% and -1.44%, respectively), while extreme cold had a positive impact (+0.22%) on the portfolio's valuation as the number of days with freezing temperatures were expected to decrease at the locations of portfolio companies. We also noted that companies engaged in the materials and real estate industry groups, as well as those operating in the U.S., China, and Canada, contributed the most to climate risks.",

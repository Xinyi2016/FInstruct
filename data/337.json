    "output": "The first data set has no natural clustering, meaning that the variables are centered on 0 and have normal distributions. This results in the algorithm targeting a user-specified number of clusters, without any inherent structure in the data. By contrast, the second data set has natural clustering, which is picked up by the k-means clustering algorithm. The elbow plot shows that the within cluster variation falls quickly as the number of clusters increases towards 5, but then falls much slower after 5. This contrasts markedly with the elbow plot for the noise cloud, where within a small distance of the origin, you may find points in any one of the five clusters. This is a feature of k-means clustering that may be contrasted with the BM representations later. The second data set recovers much of the information of the underlying data generation process that k-means has the most value to represent the point cloud.",

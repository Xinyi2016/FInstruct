    "instruction": "From the information provided, draw a conclusion about the relationship between mortgage type, loan size, and prepayment speeds.",
    "output": "Based on the exhibit and the AI model's dynamics, it can be concluded that there is a nonlinear interaction between loan size and incentive for prepayment speeds. Specifically, discount-mortgage prepayment speeds were observed to decrease with loan size, while premium-mortgage prepayment speeds increased with loan size. This finding is consistent with economic intuition and highlights the importance of considering loan type as well as size when analyzing prepayment speeds.",

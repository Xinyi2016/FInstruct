    "output": "Visualisation plays a crucial role in data analysis as it allows us to gain insights into the data that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. Anscombe\u2019s quartet (Anscombe, 1973) is a great demonstration of how visualisation can reveal the disconnect between models, summary statistics, and the actual data. The quartet consists of four datasets that have the same regression line when regressed upon a single explanatory variable. However, when viewed in a scatterplot with the independent variable on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable on the vertical axis, it becomes clear that the relationships are often non-linear and that the imposition of a linear relationship is erroneous. This highlights the importance of visualisation in ensuring that the model fit is of good quality.\n\nAnother example that emphasises the importance of visualisation is the datasaurus example of Matejka and Fitzmaurice (2017). They showed that data sets with identical summary statistics can have very different shapes. By creating a scatter plot, those shape differences are shown clearly, allowing the analyst to derive far greater insight than is provided by the summary statistics alone.\n\nHowever, it is important to ensure that visualisations are accurate and easy to interpret. Cleveland and McGill (1984a, 1984b) caution against overusing the functionality of the scatter plot and emphasise the importance of ensuring ease of accurate interpretation. In conclusion, visualisation is a powerful tool in data analysis that can reveal insights into the data that would be difficult to obtain otherwise, but it is important to use it wisely and ensure that it is accurate and easy to interpret.",

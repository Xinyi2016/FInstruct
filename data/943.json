    "output": "Even with the emergence of vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges for consumer-ABS investors. A major risk factor is the continuation of the borrower-relief programs, which may have detrimental effects on the overall performance of consumer-ABS investments. While the Biden administration and Congress are expected to continue providing stimulus checks in the short term, a full post-pandemic economic recovery will ultimately determine the long-term success of consumer-ABS investments. Therefore, it is important for investors to carefully monitor the evolving economic landscape and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.",

    "output": "The problem encountered in the evaluation of nestedness is that Temperature and NODF may depend on more basic topological properties of the networks that are not related to a particular visual pattern. For instance, the density of the network is the most important parameter in the estimation of the nestedness, so that comparing networks with different densities is problematic. Another typical source of bias in the comparison of the nestedness is given by the degree distributions (the distribution of the diversification of countries and of the ubiquity of activities) since their evolution is not random and presents high temporal persistence. The standard way to correct this issue is to extract the statistical significance of the nestedness, scattering the empirical measures with respect to those obtained in suitable random models able to represent the selected biases. For instance, the Erdos-Renyi (ER) null model draws a network ensemble constraining only the average density, while the Bipartite Configuration Model (BiCM) constrains also the average network degrees.",

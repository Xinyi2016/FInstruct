    "instruction": "Analyze the temporal evolution of energy consumption and identify the key trends and patterns.",
    "output": "Energy consumption has increased significantly over the analyzed period, with a general increase of 30% for non-renewable sources and 45% for renewable energy. The growing demand for energy is driven by factors such as population growth and increasing wealth, but this increase is not offset by improvements in energy efficiency. As a result, global energy consumption has increased nearly every year for more than half a century, with only a few exceptions in the early 1980s and in 2009 following the financial crisis. The transition to renewable energy sources is evident in the data, with a significant increase in recent years. However, the increasing energy consumption makes it more difficult to transition energy systems away from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy.",

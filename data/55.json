    "output": "The study found that the improvements in subjective well-being were large, even relative to other antipoverty interventions. For instance, the meta-analysis by Ridley et al. (2020) found that multifaceted antipoverty programs increased well-being by 0.17 standard deviations, and cash transfer programs on average increased mental health by 0.105 standard deviations. The study also compared the effect of access to microfinance, which reduced a depression index by 0.045 standard deviations. The effect observed in the study was 0.281 standard deviations, which is quite large compared to other studies. The study also noted that these other programs involved much larger transfers, with the average multifaceted antipoverty program costing $1,707 PPP and the average cash transfer costing $956 PPP. The average loan value in Angelucci et al. (2015) was $840 PPP. The study speculates that the substantial effects observed may be driven by the fact that the intervention was targeted at a specific bottleneck in the credit market, which may have allowed for more targeted and effective interventions.",

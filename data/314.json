    "output": "Network density is a measure of the number of links observed in a bipartite network relative to the maximum number of links possible in a fully connected graph. In the context of bipartite networks, each layer represents a set of nodes with different characteristics, such as countries and activities. The network density indicates the level of competitiveness of nations in each layer, with a higher density indicating a more diverse set of activities in which a nation is engaged. The time series of the density of the Scientific and Technological layers shows that nations increase their diversification as time increases, while the Economy layer features a much steadier evolution of diversification. The exponential growth of the scientific corpus is likely a major factor in the increasing density of the scientific environment.",

    "instruction": "Analyze the impact of the spike in under-renting on the expected reversionary income growth.",
    "output": "The rapid acceleration in market rental value resulted in a significant increase of 31% per square foot over the year to June 2022, while in-place rent only increased 6% over the same period. This spike in under-renting led to a reversionary potential of +34%, which is a significant increase from the +8% seen in June 2021. The increase in under-renting is also consistent with the spike in transaction-implied income growth, suggesting that buyers expect reversionary income growth in the future. Thus, the spike in under-renting is likely to have a positive impact on expected reversionary income growth, which could drive further increases in market rental value and property values in the coming years.",

    "instruction": "Could you explain the benefits of investing in ARM MBS bonds in the current market scenario?",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, ARM MBS bonds show shorter option-adjusted duration, lower spread duration, volatility, and convexity exposure compared to their fixed-rate 30-year counterparts. Banks have been accumulating ARM loans in their portfolios for this reason. Additionally, ARM MBS bonds have flatter duration profiles compared to their fixed-rate counterparts. As the Federal Reserve may tighten its monetary policy in 2022, a potential rise in rates could extend MBS duration significantly. ARM MBS bonds could provide a shelter to minimize the extension risk, making them a beneficial investment option.",

    "output": "The Kyle model suggests that the presence of competing insiders causes prices to reflect valuable information more quickly. However, it is difficult to reproduce these results in a field market because the number of informed traders is not directly observable. Our method can estimate the Kyle model implications in the field, but it relies on there being sufficient trading opportunities for informed individuals to trade a sufficient number of times at sufficient magnitude. If a market converges too quickly to the informed price, then the informed traders' price sensitivity will not be estimable, and it will appear as if there are no price-sensitive traders in the market. Therefore, a lack of detected price-sensitive traders can mean either that there are no informed traders or that there are too many. This may also mean that the data set of markets studied must be such that the markets with 0 or 1 Price sensitive traders are markets in which there may in truth be no informed traders or the information edge of the informed is very small with respect to a random guess.",

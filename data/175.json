    "output": "To develop a structural spatial model that considers the tradeoff between the benefits of concentrating skills and the benefits of more evenly distributing skills, I will first specify the agglomeration externality that arises from an increasing fraction of skilled labor in a local labor market increasing the productivity of local workers. This externality captures the idea that firms benefit from having access to a large pool of skilled workers in a particular location.\n\nNext, I will introduce a new externality that arises from signaling the expected wage associated with particular skills across potential locations. This externality captures the idea that students are more likely to acquire the skills that are in demand in their local labor market, beyond factors related to the wage. This externality can lead to a bias towards local labor market skills, which may not be sufficient to call for a more even spatial distribution of skills.\n\nTo consider the tradeoff between the benefits of concentrating skills and the benefits of more evenly distributing skills, I will assume that the impact of concentrating skills is concave, such that the benefits of concentrating skills are smaller than the benefits of more evenly distributing skills. This assumption allows me to capture the idea that there may be diminishing returns to concentrating skills in a particular location.\n\nI will also assume that concentrating skills may still create a high enough wage premium to overcome local skill bias. This assumption allows me to capture the idea that firms may be willing to pay a premium to attract skilled workers to a particular location, even if there is a bias towards local labor market skills.\n\nBy incorporating these externalities and assumptions into the structural spatial model, I will be able to consider the tradeoff between the benefits of concentrating skills and the benefits of more evenly distributing skills in a more careful manner.",

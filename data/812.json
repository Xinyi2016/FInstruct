    "instruction": "Read the paper and summarize the key points about the long-run behavior of private real estate compared to bonds and equity.",
    "output": "The research presented in the paper suggests that while private real estate may appear to have bond-like behavior in the short term due to stable income flows and delayed adjustments to appraisals, its long-run behavior is much more cyclical and growth-sensitive, making it closer to equity than many investors realize. Additionally, the data shows that real estate is a significant source of systematic risk, rather than the diversification source that it is often assumed to be. However, private real estate still offers a liquidity premium and opportunities for diversification in international markets. It is important for investors to be aware of the capital component's cyclical and growth-sensitive nature and not solely focus on the bond-like short-term risks in the lease.",

    "output": "Omitting small-cap securities from a global equity portfolio represented by the MSCI ACWI IMI would have reduced performance by over 4% during the period from December 1994 to February 2019, depriving investors of the premium historically offered by the segment over large-cap securities. On the other hand, omitting emerging markets altogether would have had an even more substantial impact on a global equity portfolio. Over different time periods, the performance variation was observed, but for the entire period from December 1987 to February 2019, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperformed the MSCI World Index by almost 3% per year.",

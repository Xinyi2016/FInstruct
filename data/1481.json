    "output": "The article outlines adverse and positive scenarios for multi-asset class portfolios based on the current global economic conditions. The scenarios include tensions between growth and deleveraging, the effectiveness of unconventional monetary and fiscal policies, the assessment of windfalls or dangers of lower oil prices, and the uncertainty created by geopolitics. The article notes that slow growth and low inflation have characterized the global economy since the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a shortage of safe assets. Central banks in Europe and Japan have pushed short-term interest rates below zero, while the Fed has delayed additional interest-rate hikes. Excessive monetary easing could increase financial instability. Lower oil prices have yet to fully benefit the global economy, and a decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union could set back growth in the U.K. and across Europe. Unconventional monetary or fiscal policies could help revive lending, borrowing, and risk-taking in a sustainable fashion.",

    "instruction": "Explain the significance of the average absolute error of 0.12 SMM in the context of the exhibit.",
    "output": "The average absolute error of 0.12 SMM in the context of the exhibit is significant because it indicates that the rank-based error-tracking methodology used to analyze the MBS pools and securities is accurate and reliable. The error-tracking methodology is used to measure the difference between the actual and predicted prepayment performance of the MBS pools and securities. The average absolute error of 0.12 SMM is within the model's acceptance criteria, which means that the methodology is able to accurately predict the prepayment performance of the MBS pools and securities across different macroeconomic environments. This is important because it allows investors and financial institutions to make informed decisions about their investments in MBS pools and securities.",

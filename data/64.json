    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed analysis of the Stackelberg equilibrium for the given scenario and discuss the implications of the proposed criteria for choosing a discount rate.",
    "output": "In the scenario of an insurance company sharing financial risk with a reinsurance company, the Stackelberg game is a suitable model to study the interaction between the two parties. The reinsurer acts as the leader and maximizes its expected utility by selecting its optimal investment strategy and a safety loading in the reinsurance contract offered to the insurer. The insurance company, being the follower, chooses its investment strategy and the amount of reinsurance purchased at the price offered by the reinsurer to maximize its expected utility.\n\nThe Stackelberg equilibrium for general utility functions has been derived in the scenario. For power utility functions, the equilibrium has been calculated explicitly, and it was found that the reinsurer selects the largest reinsurance premium such that the insurer may still buy the maximal amount of reinsurance.\n\nHowever, in practice, the reinsurer should consider charging a smaller reinsurance premium than the equilibrium one. To achieve this, several criteria have been proposed for choosing a discount rate. The wealth-equivalent impact of these criteria on the utilities of both parties has been investigated.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed criteria for choosing a discount rate can help the reinsurer to charge a smaller premium than the equilibrium value, which may be more practical in real-world scenarios. The analysis of the Stackelberg equilibrium and the impact of the proposed criteria provide valuable insights into the interaction between insurance and reinsurance companies and can help them to make more informed decisions.",

    "output": "The article discusses the importance of evaluating a firm's capital structure holistically, rather than in isolation. It highlights the case of Hertz's bankruptcy filing, which suggests that credit investors viewed potential equity sales as a bailout from equity investors, but not one that would make them whole. The article emphasizes that discrepancies in market prices across a firm's capital structure can signal market malfunction, arbitrage opportunities, or something else entirely. It also notes that the COVID-19 crisis has brought to light the importance and subtleties of firms' capital structures, and that investors should take heed of all the information the market contains about their portfolios.",

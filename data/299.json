    "output": "The fractional reserve system is a key component of the monetary system, as it defines the institutional framework for money creation. In this system, commercial banks are required to hold a certain proportion of customer deposits in liquid assets, such as cash or government bonds, as a reserve. This reserve acts as a buffer against potential losses and ensures that the bank has sufficient funds to meet customer withdrawals.\n\nThe fractional reserve system allows banks to create money by lending out a portion of their customer deposits, while keeping a portion on hand as a reserve. This process is known as fractional-reserve banking, and it plays a crucial role in the functioning of the monetary system. By lending out customer deposits, banks can increase the money supply and support economic growth.\n\nThe institutional framework of money creation is highly interrelated with the fractional reserve system, as it defines how money is created and distributed within the economy. The central bank plays a key role in this process, as it sets monetary policy and manages the supply of money in circulation. The fractional reserve system helps to ensure that the money supply remains stable and that banks are able to meet their financial obligations.\n\nOverall, the fractional reserve system is a critical component of the monetary system, as it defines the institutional framework for money creation and helps to support economic growth.",

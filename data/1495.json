    "instruction": "Research and write a report on the benefits of extracting metals from electronic waste for reducing dependency on mining and emissions.",
    "output": "In recent years, there has been a global push towards circular treatment of materials and waste, including electronic waste or e-waste. Efficiently extracting metals from e-waste has the potential to reduce dependency on mining and emissions. With China and the EU leading the charge, the U.S. has also recently passed a bill for recycling electric-vehicle batteries. In my report, I will explore in detail the benefits of extracting metals from e-waste, including reduced environmental impact and increased resource conservation. I will also discuss the challenges and potential solutions associated with this process, as well as its economic implications for the future.",

    "output": "Real estate investors can manage risks related to climate change by conducting a detailed asset-level risk exposure assessment to identify potential hazards. Based on the assessment, investors may consider avoiding high-risk areas. Another option is transferring the risk to insurance companies and tenants, but this may come at a cost of higher premiums or reduced coverage. Alternatively, investors can engage with policymakers and regulators on local climate-resilience strategies. Regardless of the approach, investors cannot ignore the risks posed by climate change.",

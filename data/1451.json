    "instruction": "Explain how the remaining lease term affects industrial returns.",
    "output": "The remaining lease term has become an important driver of industrial returns due to the rapid growth in market rents. Assets with shorter remaining lease terms have the potential to adjust their rents to market rates more quickly, while assets with longer remaining lease terms may remain rented at under-market rates for longer. This divergence is visible in industrial's total returns, with assets that have shorter remaining lease terms achieving a higher total return compared to those with longer remaining lease terms. For instance, assets with a bottom-quartile (shorter) remaining lease term witnessed a 62.6% total return in the year to June 2022, while assets with a top-quartile (longer) remaining lease term had a 36.5% total return over the same period.",

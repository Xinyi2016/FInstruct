    "output": "Local-currency indexes are commonly used in the investment process to form market views, develop strategies, and benchmark property performance. However, they do not account for currency impact and can be thought of as perfectly hedged indexes without considering costs and market frictions. For investors who are looking to hedge currency risks in their portfolios, it is important to incorporate the impact of their hedging approach in their performance benchmark as well. For private real estate, hedged indexes can be calculated using forward FX contract prices. Monthly hedge tenors are common for listed equities, but for private real estate, quarterly hedging through three-month forward FX rates is more appropriate due to lower liquidity in the asset class. The unrealized profit/loss from the forward FX contracts is then added to the performance of unhedged private-real-estate indexes on a quarterly basis to calculate the hedged index\u2019s performance.",

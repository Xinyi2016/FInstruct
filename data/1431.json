    "instruction": "Please analyze the exhibit below and provide your interpretation of how the financial supervisor's adjustments to timeframes and implementation of region-specific low-carbon strategies could impact an investor's understanding of a financial institution's resilience to climate outcomes.",
    "output": "Based on my analysis of the exhibit, the financial supervisors have made significant changes to the timeframes and strategies used to project risks related to climate change in specific regions. While these adjustments may help to provide a more accurate assessment of local conditions, they could also create confusion for investors trying to understand a financial institution's resilience to climate-related risks. It is critical for financial supervisors to communicate these changes effectively and provide transparent information to investors to help them make informed decisions about their investments.",

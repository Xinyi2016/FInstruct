    "instruction": "Based on the previous literature and the authors' analysis of Taiwan's business cycle, generate a response that explains the relationship between entrepreneurship and business cycles.",
    "output": "The relationship between entrepreneurship and business cycles is a complex one, but several studies have investigated this relationship. The authors of this paper found that people are more likely to obtain external financing during \"boom\" periods compared to \"bust\" periods, suggesting that liquidity constraints are more relaxed during booms. This finding is consistent with the literature, which has shown that entrepreneurship is more prevalent during periods of economic growth. However, the authors also found that cash windfalls have a positive effect on business start-ups during both \"bust\" and \"boom\" periods, suggesting that entrepreneurship is not solely driven by economic conditions.",

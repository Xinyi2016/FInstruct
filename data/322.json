    "output": "Governments in EMDEs (Emerging Market and Developing Economies) borrow in international markets for two reasons. Firstly, due to the relatively small size of their domestic financial markets, domestic borrowing could demand institutional investors and banks to absorb excessive debt, which could negatively affect financial stability. Secondly, EMDEs\u2019 governments usually become financial intermediaries\u2014market makers\u2014of domestic private agents that do not have access to the world capital market, either guaranteeing private external debt or taking debt abroad and then granting loans to the private sector.",

    "output": "The adaptive multi-factor model as of Dec. 31, 2020, showed an expansion in the macro-cycle pillar, resulting in an overweight to value, low size, and momentum, based on the CFNAI, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's ADS Index, and PMI. The valuation pillar also overweighted value, low size, and yield, based on the valuation gap compared to an equal-weighted factor mix in the context of nearly 30 years of a factor's history. The momentum pillar selected value, yield, and low size, based on the last three months' relative performance. Finally, the market-sentiment pillar showed a risk-on environment, which led to an underweight to low volatility, yield, and quality, and an overweight to momentum, value, and low size, based on the Cboe Volatility Index\u00ae (VIX) term structure and credit spreads. Our research has shown that taking a holistic approach to factor assessment, encompassing not only the macroeconomic environment but also factor valuations, recent performance trends, and risk sentiment, can add value in decision-making about tilting toward factors.",

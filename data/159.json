    "instruction": "Summarize the reasons why certain estimates were excluded from the paper by Howard and Sterner (2017).",
    "output": "The estimates by Meyer and Cooper (1995) were considered confused, as explained in Fankhauser and Tol (1995). Howard and Sterner (2017) reported an impact of 11.5% of GDP for 3.0 warming, which was not in Meyer and Cooper (1995). Hanemann (2008) presented estimates for the USA only, Bluedorn et al. (2009) presented no estimate. Manne et al. (1995) did not present new impact estimates, instead relying on Nordhaus and Fankhauser. Howard and Sterner (2017) misinterpreted their estimate, an annuity, as a point on the impact function. Ackerman and Stanton (2012), Bosetti et al. (2007), Gunasekera et al. (2008), Manne and Richels (2005), Tol (2013), Weitzman (2012) did not present new estimates of the total impact of climate change. Anthoff and Tol (2022) counted over 200 papers that estimate the social cost of carbon, each of which has at least one estimate of the total impact of climate change\u2014but very few of these papers present new estimates of the total impact. It is not clear why Howard and Sterner (2017) included 6 of these papers but not the other 194 or so.",

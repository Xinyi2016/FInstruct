    "output": "Labour flow networks (LFNs) are a way of conceptualizing job-to-job flows in the labour market. They represent the paths that individuals take as they move between jobs, and can be used to study the dynamics of these flows. LFNs are typically constructed using data on job-to-job transitions, and can be used to identify patterns and trends in the labour market. For example, LFNs can be used to explore how individuals move between different industries or occupations, or how they transition between different levels of education or experience. By understanding the dynamics of job-to-job flows, policymakers and researchers can gain insights into the functioning of the labour market and identify areas for improvement.",

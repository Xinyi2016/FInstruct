    "output": "As an MBS investor, it is important to pay attention to the overheating housing market and the potential risks associated with investing in newer mortgages. While the current high HPAs indicate good short-term performance for the housing market, they also indicate higher risk for the medium term. This is particularly relevant for newer mortgages, which will be most sensitive to any house-price downturns. The proposed curtailing of MBS purchases as the first step in tapering quantitative easing, and the effect of low mortgage rates on HPA should also be taken into consideration when analyzing the current housing market.",

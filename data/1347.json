    "instruction": "Using this information, write a summary of the potential impact of wildfire events on a region or asset based on their location and concentration.",
    "output": "The analysis on projected direct costs from wildfire events suggests that the potential costs per asset and MSCI ACWI IMI constituent are relatively small. However, there is a potential for devastating costs if assets are concentrated in hotspot regions. For this reason, investors should consider the location and potential impact of wildfire events when assessing regional risk profiles. This highlights the importance of diversification in geographic locations to mitigate potential losses from wildfire events.",

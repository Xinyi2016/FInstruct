    "instruction": "Can you explain how a scenario where the cost of capital rises and cross-border trade decreases could impact companies with higher leverage and dependence on international suppliers?",
    "output": "When the cost of capital rises, companies with higher leverage have faced headwinds, historically. Many companies depend on their ability to source goods from lower-cost, and often international, suppliers to keep margins healthy. Less cross-border trade could hamper this effort, and reduced cross-border capital flows could impact access to credit for certain regions. In a scenario where the cost of capital rises and cross-border trade decreases, companies with higher leverage and dependence on international suppliers may face challenges in maintaining their margins. This could lead to increased pressure on companies to automate their production processes and source goods domestically, potentially leading to a shift towards highly automated and customizable manufacturing. However, higher-quality companies with durable business models and sustainable competitive advantages may remain more resilient in this scenario. Additionally, low-volatility strategies may become more attractive as markets experience greater volatility.",

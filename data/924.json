    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the performance of value-factor indexes and cyclicals in global, regional and international markets in Q4 2020.",
    "output": "In Q4 2020, value-factor indexes across global, regional and international markets received a boost as investors increased their expectations for higher growth and a recovery of businesses hardest hit by the pandemic. This resulted in a sharp value rotation which saw the seventh-highest quarterly active return (7.3%) since 1997. Large-cap stocks which had dominated much of 2020 took a step back within developed markets, and low-size stocks outperformed in Q4. Small-over-large outperformance was most pronounced among small caps, with the MSCI ACWI Small Cap Index's active return standing at 9.0%. The MSCI World ex USA Index outperformed U.S. equities, while high dividend yield underperformed within U.S. stocks but delivered an active return of 90 bps among international equities.",

    "output": "The study of portfolio games with relative performance concerns dates back to [6], where many player portfolio games with common stocks and trading constraint were studied. In the context of a complete market, the unique NE was obtained for general utility functions. In the context of incomplete markets, the unique NE was obtained for games with exponential utility functions, where the uniqueness result was obtained by proving that the NE for the game and the solution to a multidimensional BSDE are equivalent. [7] examined similar games as [6] with a different focus: [7] constructed counterexamples where no NE exists, by proving that the corresponding multidimensional BSDE has no solution. In contrast to [6, 7] where all players trade common stocks, [13] studied portfolio games where each player trade a different but correlated stock. Assuming all market parameters to be constant, [13] obtained the unique constant NE by solving coupled HJB equations. In contrast to classical utility functions, [1, 4] studied portfolio games with forward utilities.\n\nRecently, [8] studied portfolio games with general market parameters. A one-to-one correspondence between NE and the solution to some FBSDE was established by dynamic programming principle (DPP) and martingale optimality principle (MOP), so that the portfolio game was solved by solving the FBSDE. In [8], we also obtained an asymptotic expansion result in powers of the competition parameter.",

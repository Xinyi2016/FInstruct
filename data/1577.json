    "output": "Our historically calibrated model has allowed us to assess the baseline risk for agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in 2023, taking into account the impact of spiking interest rates in 2022 and various macroeconomic uncertainties. Using our model, we have developed four risk scenarios to help investors understand the potential outcomes for agency-MBS themes in 2023. By dynamically assessing the information embedded in market dynamics and using stress analysis, investors can be better prepared for whichever scenario ultimately plays out. While the lack of historical data has made MBS modeling and risk analysis challenging, our model has allowed us to navigate uncharted territory and make informed decisions.",

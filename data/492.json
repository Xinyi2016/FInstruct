    "output": "The study found that a household\u2019s business entry responds positively to a wealth shock. Specifically, the study found that receiving a lottery prize of 1.5 million NT$ or more can significantly increase a household\u2019s probability of starting a new business by 1.5 percentage points, which is robust to different specifications and various estimated samples. The study also found that the estimated wealth elasticity of starting a business is about 0.20 to 0.36. Furthermore, the study found that the households\u2019 entrepreneurial responses show up immediately after winning a big lottery prize, implying that the affected households could already have had a business plan before receiving the cash windfalls but could not implement it due to a lack of funding. The positive effect is both statistically and economically significant at least three years following the receipt of a cash windfall. These findings suggest that wealth shocks, such as winning a lottery prize, can have a significant impact on a household\u2019s decision to start a new business. The study also implies that the effect of wealth shocks on business formation is not limited to the lottery winners but can be generalized to the whole population.",

    "instruction": "Explain the differences between the Heterogeneous agents new Keynesian (HANK) models and the proposed formalism.",
    "output": "The proposed formalism differs from HANK models in several ways. Firstly, HANK models use a probabilistic treatment similar to mean fields theory, where an equilibrium probability distribution is derived from a set of optimizing heterogeneous agents in a new Keynesian context. On the other hand, the proposed formalism focuses on the direct interactions between agents at the microeconomic level, without looking for an equilibrium probability distribution for each agent. Instead, it builds a probability density for the system of N\ud835\udc41Nitalic_N agents seen as a whole, that includes interactions, and then translates this probability density into fields.\n\nSecondly, the states' space considered in the proposed formalism is much larger than those considered in HANK models. It allows to study the agents' economic structural relations and the emergence of the particular phases or collective states induced by these specific micro-relations, that will in turn impact each agent's stochastic dynamics at the microeconomic level.\n\nLastly, the proposed formalism does not rely on agents' rationality assumptions, since for a large number of agents, behaviors, be they fully or partly rational, can be modeled as random. In contrast, HANK models stress the role of an infinite number of heterogeneously-behaved consumers.",

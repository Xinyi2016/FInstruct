    "instruction": "Please provide a report on the potential benefits of achieving net zero by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, with a focus on the reduction of climate-related risks and associated costs for at-risk companies.",
    "output": "Our analysis suggests that meeting the targets of net zero by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C could result in significant benefits for at-risk companies in sectors such as agriculture, energy, and real estate, among others. Specifically, our model indicates that achieving these targets could reduce the physical climate Value-at-Risk (VaR) of at-risk companies in these sectors by between 9 and 14 percentage points. This reduction in VaR could help to mitigate the severe risks and associated costs from climate-related weather extremes, resulting in a decrease in the number of companies at risk in these sectors from 246 (26%) to 70 (7%). Overall, the potential benefits of achieving net zero by 2050 and limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are significant for at-risk companies, and should be a key consideration for policymakers and stakeholders alike.",

    "output": "Value-at-Risk (VaR) modeling is a widely used approach in financial risk management to estimate the potential loss of a portfolio over a specific time horizon with a given confidence level. It provides a measure of the maximum loss that can be expected from a portfolio, given the historical data and the assumed distribution of returns. The accuracy of VaR modeling depends on the availability of an accurate pricing model and the assumption that the risk factors exhibit a stationary property. The stationarity assumption implies that the distribution of returns remains constant over time, allowing for the use of historical data to make predictions about future losses. The OAS is a commonly used pricing model in VaR modeling, and its accuracy can be tested by comparing its daily changes to a uniform distribution. The exhibit provided shows the distribution of daily changes in the OAS for a specific mortgage-backed security in 2019, with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics of 0.038, which is within the acceptance criteria. This suggests that the OAS is a suitable pricing model for VaR modeling in this case.",

    "output": "The study in Table Tables investigates the impact of lottery prizes on households' entrepreneurial decisions. The results show that receiving cash windfalls of less than 30 million NT$ can increase the probability of establishing a business by 1.2 percentage points. However, the positive impact of winning a big lottery prize on entrepreneurial activities becomes nine times greater when the winning prize exceeds 30 million NT$. For households whose wins range from 30 to 100 million NT$, the chances of starting a business increase by 10.2 percentage points, but the estimated effect does not continue to increase and actually becomes smaller when the lottery prize surpasses 100 million NT$.",

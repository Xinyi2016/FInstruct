    "output": "Our analysis suggests that changes in equity-market valuations, analysts\u2019 consensus earnings estimates, and data on companies\u2019 revenue exposure are metrics that provided insight into recent market and sector performances amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. The China A shares market, represented by the MSCI China A Index, declined more than 25% since the start of the trade dispute to the end of 2018, to a four-year low, when compared to the MSCI USA Index. Furthermore, the 2018 selloff compressed the A shares\u2019 average price-to-book ratio to a multiyear low. The historical revisions of 2019 earnings estimates for companies in the MSCI USA Index, broken into quartiles based on their revenue exposures to China, imply that until mid-2018, analysts revised their 2019 earnings estimates upwards for the U.S. companies most exposed to China (quartile 4). However, during the second half of 2018, consensus earnings for companies with above-average exposure to China (quartiles 3 and 4) got revised downward amid rising perceived risk of an imminent trade war. Heading into the reporting seasons in January, 2019 earnings estimates were revised further downward, and more significantly for companies with higher China exposure, as many of them cited a negative outlook due to the impact of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Companies\u2019 particular economic exposures seem to have made them more or less sensitive to trade-war risk, and we used this to identify potential trade-related risks and opportunities at the sector and stock levels. The potential for geopolitical conflict between the world\u2019s two largest economies represents an ongoing risk to global economic growth and market performance, regardless of whether or not China and the U.S. strike a trade deal in 2019. Thus, investors should consider reading beyond the news headlines to understand what drives the underlying equity-market performance.",

    "instruction": "As a portfolio manager, devise a strategy that can reduce transaction costs during periods of market volatility while still maintaining a reasonable level of tracking error with a bond index.",
    "output": "One potential approach to reducing transaction costs during volatile market periods while also minimizing tracking error with a bond index is to use a \"smart turnover\" replication technique. This method involves constructing a hypothetical portfolio that is transaction-cost aware and aims to track the underlying bond benchmark. By buying fewer bonds in the portfolio than in the benchmark and allowing portfolio weights to differ from the benchmark's, transaction costs can be reduced without compromising too much on tracking accuracy. Our analysis has shown that, during the COVID-19 crisis, this approach may have helped significantly lower transaction costs without sacrificing tracking performance.",

    "output": "Say-on-climate votes are management-backed resolutions that ask shareholders to approve a company's climate plan or climate-action report on either a one-time or recurring basis. While these votes are often nonbinding and advisory, strong opposition from shareholders could signal to directors to carefully consider the result in developing their approach to climate change. The adoption of say-on-climate votes could increase as more companies try to sell investors on their climate strategies. However, concerns have been raised that this practice could be a distraction or facilitate greenwashing. As of Feb. 1, 2022, only 33 companies in MSCI ESG Ratings coverage had held or scheduled say-on-climate votes, but this issue may remain on the agenda as investors increase their scrutiny of companies' climate practices.",

    "output": "The trend towards the use of smaller boats for migrants crossing on the Central Mediterranean route may have several implications. On the one hand, smaller boats with fewer passengers may be less likely to sink due to overcrowding, which can make boats less seaworthy. Overcrowding can cause boats to sit lower in the water and be more susceptible to waves, or cause inflatable tubes to collapse in rubber rafts or wooden boats to tip. On the other hand, smaller boats may be more susceptible to weather conditions on the open water and less likely to be detected at sea, which could increase the risk of shipwrecks and deaths. The rise in the rate of deaths reported by the IOM along the Central Mediterranean route after 2017 suggests that deaths may be occurring during LCG interceptions or that ships are sinking without a rescue or interception being initiated.",

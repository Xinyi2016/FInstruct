    "output": "Nuclear power poses two unique challenges. An expansion of the nuclear power supply large enough to have a notable effect on greenhouse gas emissions and so climate change would require the building of nuclear power plants in currently unstable countries. The first challenge is that the people who run a nuclear power plant, know how to and have the material to build a dirty bomb. Secondly, as illustrated by the second Russian invasion of Ukraine, it is a really bad idea to situate a nuclear power plant in a war zone.",

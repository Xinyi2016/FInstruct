    "instruction": "Can you provide an analysis of the performance of the yield factor in the lead-up to the Global Financial Crisis and in the current phase of the market?",
    "output": "Sure, in the pre-GFC period from 2002 to 2006, the yield factor consistently outperformed by around two percentage points. This was due to strong inflows of capital to higher-yielding asset types and locations in search of returns. However, in the current phase of the market, the starting point for the yield factor was somewhat different. After the initial recovery from the GFC, there was more muted performance around 2012 associated with the Eurozone crisis. However, there was a period of strong returns where the yield factor once again outperformed, but this gradually ebbed away to the point where its returns were negligible and then turned negative through COVID. The yield factor has since become positive again during the bounce-back of 2021.",

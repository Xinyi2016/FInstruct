    "instruction": "Analyze the data presented in the exhibit below and explain how global firms differ from local firms in terms of their production and supply chain operations.",
    "output": "The exhibit shows that global firms have a higher share of their production located outside of Europe compared to local firms. This suggests that global firms are more likely to adapt their production and strategy to local-market needs by locating their operations closer to their end markets. Overall, the data indicates that global firms have more globalized operations and supply chains compared to local firms, which may give them a competitive advantage in the global marketplace.",

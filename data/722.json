    "instruction": "Please provide a brief summary of the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global markets.",
    "output": "According to our what-if scenario analysis, if there is a short-term drop in growth of 2 percentage points and a risk-premium increase of 2 percentage points, there is room for further short-term losses in markets. U.S. equities could drop by a further 11%, while a hypothetical global multi-asset-class portfolio could lose another 7%. In the long-term, if there is a pandemic and the economy declines, the rebound from a market correction may be slower, and markets would feel a longer-lasting effect. Therefore, growth expectations and the degree of risk aversion adopted by market participants will play a crucial role in determining the extent of the market effects caused by the coronavirus outbreak.",

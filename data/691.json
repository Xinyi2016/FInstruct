    "instruction": "Based on the information provided, write a paragraph discussing the impact of the inclusion of China A share companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.",
    "output": "The inclusion of 472 large- and mid-cap China A share companies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in 2019 had a significant impact on China's weight in the index, increasing it to about 33%. Additionally, the trading liquidity of index constituents increased notably during the two-year period between 2017 and 2019, especially in the information technology and healthcare sectors. The inclusion of China A shares in the index may have also played a role in increasing foreign institutional investors' participation in the domestic equity market. Overall, the emerging-market equity segment has evolved significantly since MSCI announced the inclusion, with sector exposure and liquidity improving, as well as foreign participation increasing.",

    "output": "I agree with the potential explanations provided for the lower contribution observed from allocation. Benchmark weightings can often constrain the allocation scores, which can limit the effectiveness of the allocation strategy in actual portfolio construction and management. Additionally, traditional benchmark segmentations based on property type and geography may overlook other systematic drivers of return that could be used to create alternative segmentations. Considering these alternative segmentations could lead to increased tracking error explained by allocation. Overall, it is essential to reevaluate benchmark weightings and segmentations regularly to ensure the allocation strategy is as effective as possible in reflecting an investor's objectives.",

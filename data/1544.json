    "output": "Our research indicates that the introduction of a new, volume-based approach would have demonstrated improving liquidity during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, as traded volumes increased significantly during that period. In contrast, the current, price-impact approach would have captured the deteriorating market liquidity.

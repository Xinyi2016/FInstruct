    "instruction": "Please provide an overview of the performance of the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes in 2022 and explain the factors that contributed to their full-year underperformance.",
    "output": "In 2022, the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes underperformed the MSCI ACWI Index for the full year, primarily due to the outperformance of the energy sector and a rally in value stocks. However, higher-rated ESG companies did contribute positively to their performance. The MSCI ACWI ESG Universal and MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders Indexes outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index in the fourth quarter. Industry exposures such as an energy-sector underweight introduced by the application of values-based exclusions or climate-related investor preferences in the ESG Leaders and SRI Indexes have negatively impacted their performance. Nonetheless, the MSCI ACWI ESG Indexes maintained a robust ESG profile and met their objectives of values alignment and ESG integration.",

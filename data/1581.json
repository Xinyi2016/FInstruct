    "instruction": "Please analyze the recent prepayment speeds for agency MBS and determine if the prepayment model is still appropriate.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, we have found that prepayment speeds for agency MBS slowed down significantly in 2022 across all cohorts. MSCI\u2019s MBS-prepayment model has an error margin of 1 CPR, and historically, its accuracy has been primarily influenced by the refinance component. However, by the end of 2022, base prepayment speeds emerged as the dominant components, such as those driven by housing turnover. This shift is critical to ensure that the prepayment model is appropriate during this transition phase with clear differentiation, as shown in the MSCI rank-based error tracking. We recommend further analysis to determine the impact of this shift on the prepayment model's accuracy and the necessary adjustments to maintain its relevance in predicting prepayment speeds for agency MBS.",

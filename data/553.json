    "instruction": "Analyze the impact of new tariffs on the technology sector with a focus on revenue exposure to China.",
    "output": "Based on our investigation, US information technology firms have a relatively large exposure to China which makes them vulnerable to tariffs. This was evident from March 7 as tech firms with higher revenue exposure to China saw a negative reversal of fortune. In contrast, firms with lower levels of exposure benefited. To investigate the impact of tariffs, we created a portfolio that selected the top decile of firms in the MSCI USA Index with revenue exposure to China. We compared its performance before and after March 7 and found that the selloff was broad-based affecting a range of stocks. Furthermore, our simulated portfolio that was overweight in computer electronics and food-related industries specifically targeted by China suffered the most. The precision of Chinese tariffs on industries in specific constituencies and geographies became apparent when we examined the returns to industry factors. Semiconductors, semiconductor equipment manufacturers, and food exports all became more volatile throughout March, and then fell sharply mid-April with the first announcement of retaliatory tariffs. Therefore, investors may want to examine economic exposure which more precisely identifies firms at risk across multiple industries that may suffer due to retaliatory tariff announcements.",

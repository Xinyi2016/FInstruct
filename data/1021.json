    "output": "Dear Investment Advisor, \nAs an asset allocator, I am interested in adding thematic investments to my equity program. I understand that this may introduce volatility to my traditional growth allocation, but I am interested in exploring all options. Can you provide me with more information on how much of my equity program should be dedicated to a thematic allocation, and the risks and benefits associated with this allocation? Also, I would like to know if adding a low-volatility allocation would help reduce risk and balance the trade-offs between higher levels of innovation and risk. Thank you for your expertise and guidance on this matter. \nBest regards, [Your Name]",

    "instruction": "Analyze the potential impact of a trade war on global equities and developed market government bonds based on hypothetical scenarios.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis of hypothetical scenarios using MSCI's stress-testing tools, global equities are projected to lose under both a U.S.-China trade war scenario and an all-out trade war scenario. However, the losses are worse under the latter scenario, with a potential 10% price drop. Government bonds, on the other hand, gain under both scenarios, with a larger gain in the U.S.-China trade war scenario. Including currency effects, the impact on global equity and bond returns would be worse for U.S. investors due to a strengthening U.S. dollar. It's important to note that while equity markets have priced in the U.S.-China scenario, the Chinese equity market has outperformed the projection, suggesting financial markets currently deem China to be more resilient.",

    "instruction": "Please explain why the MSCI China A 50 Connect Index and the MSCI USA 50 Index were chosen as building blocks for the hypothetical mega-cap USA/China portfolio.",
    "output": "We chose the MSCI China A50 Connect and MSCI USA 50 Indexes because they cover 40% to 50% of the market cap and profit of their corresponding parent indexes. Additionally, they hold a significant share of risk in the MSCI USA Index and the MSCI China A Index, as shown in the exhibit below. By using these two indexes as building blocks, we can assess and analyze the diversification effects of a mega-cap USA/China portfolio.",

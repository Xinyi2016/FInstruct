    "output": "The paper aims to address the problem of a market-maker providing the vast majority of the liquidity on an underlying asset. The market-maker faces a very high number of traders, or market-takers, with possibly different behaviors such as momentum or mean reverting strategies. The market-maker proposes quotes based on her inventory process and the behavior of her counterparts, which are aggregated through a mean-field game. The problem is formulated as a mean-field game with controlled jumps. The market-maker computes the average fair price of the mean-field and adjusts her strategy accordingly. The paper characterizes the problem by a system of Fokker-Planck equations for the mean-field game associated to the minor players, and a decoupled HJB equation for the major player. The optimal strategies of both the representative market-taker and the market-maker are derived. The numerical results show that the market-takers' inventory shifts with the exogenous trading signal and the market-maker's strategy is adjusted accordingly. The behavior of market-takers is not fixed as a function of the quotes of the market-maker only, but as a function of their own view on the price process as well as their current inventory. The model also provides the optimal strategy of an informed market-taker, which is absent in previous models.",

    "output": "Proper default risk simulations are crucial in the banking industry as they help banks to identify and assess the potential risks associated with lending to counterparties. By simulating different default scenarios, banks can better understand the potential impact of defaults on their portfolios and take appropriate measures to mitigate those risks. The collapse of Greensill is a prime example of how improper risk assessment can lead to significant losses for both the bank and taxpayers. Therefore, it is essential for banks to invest in proper default risk simulations to ensure the stability and resilience of the financial system.",

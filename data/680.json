    "instruction": "Please provide an explanation of the consistent positive value exposure maintained by Fund 1 over a 10-year period and the trend seen in the past two years for growth and momentum exposure. Also, please discuss the peak value exposure of Fund 2 and the current positive growth and momentum exposures for it.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, it was found that over a 10-year period, Fund 1 consistently maintained a positive value exposure strategy. However, we also observed that over the past two years, their exposure to growth and momentum has trended lower, suggesting that their stock holdings may have had lower growth and momentum exposure compared to the MSCI EAFE Index. In contrast, Fund 2 peaked in August 2016 with a value exposure of +0.09. Currently, as of September 2019, both growth and momentum exposures for Fund 2 are positive at +0.24 and +0.10 respectively. It seems like Fund 1 has consistently followed a value-oriented strategy over the years, whereas Fund 2 may have drifted away from a value strategy or even changed strategies entirely. Overall, establishing a consistent standard for comparison across time helped in providing greater transparency in comparing factor exposures for each fund.",

    "output": "The top three drivers behind last year's rally in global equities were the emerging markets rally, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, and the resurgence of global growth. Despite the rally being led by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index with a 38% return, the MSCI World Index also had a solid return of 23%. Emerging markets benefited from equity gains, currency appreciation, and tightening spreads on sovereign bonds. This trend is expected to continue in 2018 as individual emerging market economies become more distinct from one another.\n\nThe U.S. dollar's depreciation against major currencies resulted in a tailwind to robust local market returns for dollar-based investors. International developed stocks benefited the most, with currency accounting for almost 40% of the total return in the MSCI World ex USA index. Low inflation and corporate earnings growth, particularly in the emerging markets, also contributed to positive investor sentiment. \n\nFinally, year-over-year real earnings growth was positive for most countries, particularly in the second half of the year when earnings in European countries rose. However, valuations varied significantly across regions and individual countries, with some benefiting from growth but suffering from valuation contraction. The sector makeup of individual countries also played an important role in return differences between stocks. Looking forward, investors will be monitoring if these favorable conditions can persist and how well individual countries are positioned to benefit if they do.",

    "instruction": "Explain the implications of the results discussed in the text for the evaluation of the innovation effects of RJVs.",
    "output": "The results show that RJVs can be beneficial for inducing innovation under certain circumstances, but can also be harmful in others. Therefore, it is important to understand the incentives of firms to form RJVs in each case. The text also states that if firms only had an incentive to form RJVs that reduce innovation, then lenient policy towards them would be misguided. The text goes on to say that there are general and widely applicable conditions under which firms benefit from forming RJVs that increase the innovation probability, but there are also circumstances under which firms engage in RJVs even though they reduce overall innovation.",

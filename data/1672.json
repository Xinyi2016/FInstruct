    "output": "The research we conducted focused on understanding how ESG characteristics have financially significant effects rather than solely relying on correlations between ESG characteristics and financial performance. We identified three transmission channels within a discounted cash flow model which are the cash-flow channel, the idiosyncratic risk channel, and the valuation channel. High ESG-rated companies can generate abnormal returns leading to higher profitability and dividend payments through the cash-flow channel. Through the idiosyncratic risk channel, high ESG-rated companies are better at managing company-specific business and operational risks and have a lower probability of suffering incidents that can impact their share price, resulting in lower idiosyncratic tail risks. High ESG-rated companies tend to have lower exposure to systematic risk factors, which leads to lower expected cost of capital, and higher valuations in a DCF model framework through the valuation channel. ESG ratings provide valuable information for both systematic risks and stock-specific risks. Additionally, a change in a company's ESG characteristics was found to be a leading indicator for changes in systematic and idiosyncratic risk, which we call \"ESG momentum.\" ESG momentum may be a useful financial indicator in its own right and investors may choose to use this signal in addition to ESG ratings in portfolio construction methodologies. Our research demonstrated that ESG has affected the valuation and performance of companies through their systematic risk profile (lower costs of capital and higher valuations) and their idiosyncratic risk profile (higher profitability and lower exposures to tail risk). The impact of ESG ratings on systematic and idiosyncratic risks lasted for several years during the study period, potentially making them suitable for inclusion in the asset allocation process and policy benchmarks.",

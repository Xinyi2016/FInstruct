    "instruction": "Please provide a summary of the performance of the oil and gas industry factors in the first, second, and third quarters, and their impact on the MSCI ACWI ESG index.",
    "output": "The exploration/development of oil and gas, as well as the industry factors associated with oil and gas and consumable fuels, performed positively in the first and second quarters, but experienced a significant decrease in the third quarter. Similarly, the aerospace/defense and integrated oil and gas industry factors also transitioned from positive to negative. The energy prices in the second wave that affected energy-intensive companies may have contributed to this trend. As a result of this performance change, the impact on the overall active performance of industry factors in various MSCI ACWI ESG indices was significant in the first half of the year, but became insignificant in the third quarter.",

    "instruction": "Based on the findings at the sector level, explain the dominance of emissions from energy, materials, and utilities firms in the private space.",
    "output": "The sector level analysis revealed that energy, materials, and utilities firms were dominant emitters in the private space. However, the average emissions intensity of utilities alone was found to be much higher than the remaining Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae) sectors by a factor of 21. Furthermore, it was interesting to observe that while energy is often under the scanner for emissions output, both materials and utilities ranked higher than energy in terms of emission intensity.",

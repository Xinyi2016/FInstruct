    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed analysis of the risk and correlation of private infrastructure with the broader portfolio, and suggest return expectations needed to justify an allocation to this asset class.",
    "output": "Based on our analysis, private infrastructure has demonstrated low correlation with traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income, highlighting its potential diversification benefits for portfolios. However, private infrastructure investments are subject to various risks, including regulatory, political, and operational risks. Our return expectations for private infrastructure investments are contingent upon a thorough assessment of these risks, as well as estimated cash flow generation potential and exit strategies. Furthermore, we recommend utilizing advanced analytical models to estimate return expectations, rather than relying solely on valuation and proxy-based estimates. Overall, we believe private infrastructure can play a valuable role in a diversified portfolio, but it is imperative to carefully evaluate risk and return expectations before making allocation decisions.",

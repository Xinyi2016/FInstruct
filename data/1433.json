    "instruction": "As a financial institution, you need to evaluate your portfolio climate risks and evaluate your counterparties through the low-carbon transition. To do this, you need to fill the data gaps for value-chain emissions (Scope 3) and disclose your greenhouse gas emissions in the MSCI ACWI IMI.",
    "output": "Thank you for the instruction. We understand that it is important to evaluate our portfolio climate risks and evaluate our counterparties through the low-carbon transition. We will work to fill the data gaps for value-chain emissions (Scope 3) and disclose our greenhouse gas emissions in the MSCI ACWI IMI. However, we also note the systemic limitations highlighted by the NGFS and the lack of available data for many financial institutions. We will do our best to align with NGFS reference scenarios while acknowledging these challenges.",

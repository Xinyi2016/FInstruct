    "instruction": "Please summarize the model's implication regarding the rates-equity correlation and its projected evolution into macro scenarios.",
    "output": "According to the model, there is a threshold for the rates-equity correlation to fall to zero and it would require a doubling in inflation uncertainty. Returning to historical negative correlations would require even higher levels of inflation risk. While projections of macroeconomic scenarios over the next decade indicate a moderate decline in the rates-equity correlation, more than three-quarters of the projected scenarios retain a positive correlation for the full decade ahead. Overall, the analysis suggests there is some likelihood of a weakening relationship between rates and equity, but a return to the correlations of the last century would likely require a return to the weak central-bank policy and high inflation of those times.",

    "output": "Volatility clustering refers to the tendency for high-volatility events to occur in clusters or bunches in time. This means that periods of high market volatility tend to be followed by more periods of high volatility, and vice versa. This phenomenon has important implications for financial markets, as it suggests that investors may face more risk during certain periods than they do during others. For example, if an investor is holding a portfolio of assets that are subject to volatility clustering, they may experience significant losses during a period of high volatility, even if the overall trend in the market is upward. As a result, investors may need to be more careful about managing their risks during periods of high volatility, and may need to adjust their portfolios accordingly.",

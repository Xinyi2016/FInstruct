    "output": "As an investor, it is important to be mindful of the potential spillover effects of the recent COVID-19 lockdowns in China on the global economy. Given China's significance in the global supply chain, these lockdowns can add another headwind to the world's second-largest economy, potentially fueling increased decoupling of China from the global economy. This, combined with China's real estate debt crisis and regulatory changes, as well as geopolitical tensions, could lead to a growth slowdown and economic decoupling, which could have an impact on a diversified portfolio consisting of global equities and U.S. bonds and real estate. Our stress test's most dire scenario assumes a 9% loss in such a portfolio. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to stay informed and be prepared for potential market volatility in the face of these challenges.",

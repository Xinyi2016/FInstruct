    "instruction": "Please explain why new, smaller securities are usually included in index reviews and how MSCI GIMI ensures relevant index composition.",
    "output": "New, smaller securities may be included as part of regular index reviews to group index turnover at designated times. This is important because usually such smaller securities have had a correspondingly smaller impact on index composition individually. MSCI GIMI works to maintain relevant index composition by ensuring that large IPOs, like the case of Saudi Aramco, are included in equity indexes outside scheduled index review cycles as they can significantly change the opportunity set. In Aramco's case, even though it had a low free float of 0.5%, it was added to MSCI GIMI on Dec. 18, 2019, helped by its high total market capitalization of USD 1,877 billion as of the close of business on Dec. 11, 2019. On the inclusion date, Aramco accounted for only 0.02% of the MSCI ACWI Index and 0.16% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, but contributed 6.37% to the MSCI Saudi Arabia Index. This example shows how timely index inclusion of newly eligible large companies could be very important for investors focusing on a specific country.",

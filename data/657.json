    "output": "Investors with strong convictions who are considering investing in emerging markets need to carefully weigh the risks involved. One of the key considerations they need to keep in mind is that equity performance across emerging markets is less correlated than in developed markets. This means that investors need to be aware that the performance of one EM country does not necessarily reflect the performance of others.\n\nAnother consideration is the wide dispersion of reactions to macroeconomic variables such as economic exposure, currencies, and commodities. These variables can be affected by major global events, which can increase volatility in EM markets.\n\nIf an investor wants to express their views on a specific theme, approaches based on single-country indexes may be beneficial. However, it is important to keep in mind that these approaches carry their own risks, and investors should carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.",

The optimizer is set with a termination tolerance of 10\u22124superscript10410^{-4}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. The left panel shows that DDSG provides roughly 30%percent3030\\%30 % reduction in the number of function calls compared to SG. The right panel shows the relative compute times of the naive and vectorized approach for DDSG interpolation. The naive approach is the evaluation of (4.18) directly, while the vectorized approach provides a speedup of roughly 2.82.82.8 times that of the naive implementation.",

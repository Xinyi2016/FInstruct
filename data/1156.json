    "output": "Consumer and mortgage credit availability is an important policy factor that affects the housing market. During the 2003-2007 housing bubble, there was a significant expansion of consumer over-leverage, with household debt increasing from about 80% to 100% of nominal GDP. This expansion of credit contributed to about 6.3% of house-price expansion during that time. However, in the current housing market, we haven't seen this type of dramatic expansion of consumer debt and mortgage debt as a percentage of the GDP. This is a positive sign, as it indicates that there is less risk of a housing bubble in the current market.",

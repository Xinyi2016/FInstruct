The advantage of this approach is that one does not need to calculate implied volatilities from option prices while assuming a specific option pricing model; instead, we use quoted implied volatilities directly. In the empirical application, we retrieve already annualized implied volatilities as given by the USD/RUB and EUR/RUB options traded at-the-money (ATM), which have the same delta for a monthly maturity. We use 5\u2212limit-from55-5 -minute data from the UTC timezone. The implied volatility averaged across the 4\u2212limit-from44-4 -hour window is given by the following:",

    "output": "One effective strategy to onboard younger directors could be to pair them with a mentor from the board who can guide and support them in their new role. Additionally, offering educational resources and training programs specific to board work could help bridge any knowledge gaps and ensure they feel comfortable contributing to board discussions and decision-making. It may also be important to establish clear expectations and communication protocols from the outset to maximize their contributions despite potential time constraints. By providing a supportive and inclusive onboarding experience, we can harness the unique perspectives and expertise of younger directors to drive innovation and success.",

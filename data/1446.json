    "output": "Despite global inflation, Japan's refusal to implement changes in monetary policies has led to a significant depreciation of the yen against the dollar, the highest in 24 years. The fate of the yen may be determined by factors outside of Japan's control because of the wide range of policies by the Bank of Japan. We examined three scenarios - scenario of slowing inflation, scenario of inflation acceleration, and scenario of global recession. The value of the yen increased in the scenario of recession. The Bank of Japan may have relinquished control of its fate by clinging to the zero interest rate policy. This is evidenced by the statement by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan: \"Stopping the yen's depreciation through interest rate adjustments would require a significant increase in interest rates that would damage the economy\". As a result, investors with exposure to Japan and the yen may need to look outside Japan to understand the risk factors associated with their portfolios.",

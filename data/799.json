    "output": "We have conducted an attribution analysis of our real estate portfolios since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis reveals that asset selection has continued to play an important role in driving relative returns, particularly during periods of disruption. In addition, the analysis shows that market timing and allocation decisions have also had a significant impact on portfolio performance. Our insights suggest that a combination of defensive positioning and selective exposure to high-quality assets may help to mitigate downside risk and enhance performance in the current environment. We have provided a detailed report outlining these findings and recommendations for communicating the idiosyncratic aspects of the portfolios to our investors.",

    "output": "As a food producer, our company recognizes the growing physical and regulatory risks posed by continued forest loss and the pressure from COP15 to tackle deforestation, especially in biodiversity-sensitive regions. Our analysis has flagged our company as having the potential for direct or indirect contribution to deforestation, which is a concerning finding. To address this issue, we are committed to implementing sustainable sourcing strategies and working with our suppliers to ensure responsible land use practices, particularly in regions where deforestation is a risk. We are also exploring the use of MSCI's Biodiversity Screening Metrics to help manage biodiversity risks in our portfolio. We recognize the importance of healthy forests for our industry and our planet, and are committed to doing our part in preserving these critical ecosystem services for future generations.",

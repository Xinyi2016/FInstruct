    "output": "According to the MSCI Mexico Index, there has been a significant improvement in ESG ratings over the past five years, with a decrease in the market cap of ESG laggards from 60% to 40% currently. Although the percentage of top-rated companies remains small, the segment of the market with average ESG ratings has increased to nearly two-thirds of the overall market. Our prior research has shown that even limited improvements in ESG ratings can have a greater impact than companies with higher ratings. However, there is evidence of slippage, as the market cap and number of lowest-rated companies have increased in recent years.",

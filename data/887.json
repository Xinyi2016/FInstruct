    "instruction": "Based on our model's findings, please provide your recommendation for investing in the U.S. equity market for the next decade.",
    "output": "Our model suggests that while U.S. equity valuations are consistent with a scenario of moderate recession, the total expected equity return over the next decade is much lower than the realized return of the 2010s. Therefore, we recommend investors carefully consider their risk appetite and diversify their portfolios to include other asset classes with higher expected returns. It's important to keep in mind that although the market has rebounded strongly, there remains an uncertain economic outlook due to the ongoing pandemic and other geopolitical factors.",

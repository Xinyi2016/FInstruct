    "output": "Markowitz mean-variance portfolios are a popular method for constructing portfolios that balance risk and return. However, they have several issues in practice, including poor out-of-sample performance due to estimation error, extreme weights that are sensitive to changes in input parameters, and heavy-tailed characteristics of financial time series that cause erratic fluctuations in weights and transaction costs.\n\nTo address these issues, the proposed method uses a projected gradient descent technique to avoid the estimation and inversion of the covariance operator and focuses on robust estimation of the gradient descent increment. The method also uses modern tools of robust statistics to construct a computationally efficient estimator with almost Gaussian properties based on the median-of-means uniformly over weights.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that the proposed robustified Markowitz approach results in portfolios with lower turnover compared to shrinkage-based and constrained portfolios, while preserving or slightly improving out-of-sample performance. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the issues with Markowitz mean-variance portfolios.",

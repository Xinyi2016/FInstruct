These scenarios aim to assess the impact of various shocks, including a year of oil at $10 a barrel, a year of oil at $35 with an uptick in systemic risk, and a year of oil at $35 without an uptick in systemic risk.",
    "output": "By using MSCI's RiskManager or Macroeconomic Risk Model and Scenario Analysis Service, investors can stress test their multi-asset class portfolio based on the above-mentioned scenarios. They can expect to see the impact of various shocks, including defaults by energy companies, credit losses to banks, and the loss of value to the U.S. financial sector. They can also see how growth declines by 3.1% in developed economies and by 4.9% in emerging markets over the period. In the first scenario, a multi-asset class portfolio invested globally could lose 17.3%. In the second scenario, a multi-asset class portfolio invested worldwide could lose 5.1%. In the third scenario, a multi-asset class portfolio invested globally could gain 3.5%. Investors can use the information presented to make informed decisions about their portfolio and how they can mitigate risks posed by potential shocks.",

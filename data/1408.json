    "instruction": "Write a paragraph discussing the impact of Abe's corporate-reform policies on Japan's competitiveness and governance.",
    "output": "Abe's commitment to improving corporate competitiveness and governance in Japan has had a positive impact, but challenges still remain. The \"three arrows\" program of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms implemented under Abe's leadership had some setbacks, including the yen's prolonged depreciation. While Japanese corporations continue to trail behind those in other developed markets in profitability, board independence, and diversity, increased focus on transparency and shareholder engagement has exposed high-profile corporate scandals. Nonetheless, Shinzo Abe's victory in Japan's recent election suggests that his corporate-reform policies will continue to endure and drive growth in the years to come.",

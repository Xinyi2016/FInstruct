    "instruction": "Please analyze the effect of microcaps on index liquidity in both Japan and the U.S. by comparing the number of illiquid stocks included in their respective total-market universes.",
    "output": "After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that the effect of microcaps on index liquidity varies between Japan and the U.S. In Japan, as the universe expanded beyond the investable universe, the number of illiquid stocks steadily increased, with over 200 illiquid stocks included in the total-market universe. On the other hand, in the U.S., the number of illiquid stocks was smaller, indicating a lesser effect of microcaps on index liquidity. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the selection of stocks when constructing index funds in markets where microcaps are prevalent.",

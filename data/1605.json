    "instruction": "Use the MSCI Economic Exposure data to assess the impact of China's COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent reopening on global equities with significant revenue exposure to China. Provide recommendations on how investors can weigh broad-market risk versus specific risk in relation to China exposure.",
    "output": "Based on the MSCI Economic Exposure data, we can see that last year's sell-off in Chinese stocks had an adverse effect on global equities with significant revenue exposure to China, but these stocks outperformed during the reopening of the country. As investors consider their investment strategy, it is important to weigh broad-market risk versus specific risk driven by their China exposure.\n\nTo do this, investors could use a scenario-analysis framework that takes into account the varying economic scenarios that could arise. By considering the potential impact of various scenarios on their China exposure, investors can make informed decisions on which stocks may perform well under different circumstances.\n\nOverall, while individual stocks may vary in their response to China's economic environment, taking a macro view of the situation and evaluating the potential impact of scenarios can help investors to make sound investment decisions.",

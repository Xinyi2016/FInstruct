    "instruction": "Please analyze the potential contagion risk of the recent market corrections in Argentina and Turkey to other emerging-market countries.",
    "output": "Our analysis indicates that there has not been widespread contagion to other EM countries at this point. However, some countries, such as Russia, South Africa, Brazil, and Indonesia, have experienced some movement in line with Argentina and Turkey's market corrections. These countries may share similar vulnerabilities, including high foreign currency debt and political instability, making them more sensitive to Argentina and Turkey's problems. Investors should pay attention to these countries and their exposure to potential weaknesses ahead of any potential correction. Furthermore, our findings suggest that a few vulnerable countries' bond and currency markets may be experiencing a fundamental change, which would make past returns less accurate as a guide to future correlations and risk.",

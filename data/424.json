    "output": "Choice overload refers to the phenomenon where individuals have difficulty making decisions when presented with too many options. This concept challenges the standard model of utility maximization in economics, as it suggests that individuals may not always act in their own best interests when faced with an overwhelming number of choices. Additionally, choice overload is not well explained by some behavioral theories, such as reference dependence and limited attention models. As a result, more exotic elements such as regret, rational contextual inference, or decision avoidance may be necessary to understand this phenomenon. From a normative perspective, the concept of choice overload calls into question the assumption that increasing the set of options available to consumers always leads to improved welfare. This has important implications for policy recommendations in economics.",

    "output": "The z-score values measure the distance of empirical values from ensemble averages in terms of ensemble standard deviations. A higher z-score value indicates a greater distance from the ensemble average, while a lower z-score value indicates a closer distance to the ensemble average. In the context of the study, the z-score values are used to measure the difference between the nestedness of the empirical network and the random case. The results show that in all layers, the nestedness of the empirical network is much higher than in the random case, indicating that the network has a persistent dynamics that affects the evolution of the nestedness.",

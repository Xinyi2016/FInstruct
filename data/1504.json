    "output": "Based on the uncertain market environment, it is important to analyze our portfolio under different scenarios. If economic growth remains strong and inflation is kept in check, then investments in sectors such as technology, financials, and consumer discretionary may perform well. However, if the Fed's response to inflation is too aggressive and leads to a global recession, defensive sectors like utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples may be better investments. It\u2019s important to diversify our portfolio to mitigate risk and have exposure to a variety of sectors that may perform well under different scenarios.",

    "output": "Our research involves using the concept of equity as a call option on a firm's value to calculate default probabilities from equity prices and vice versa. To model Russian equity prices, we have also taken into account the implied default probabilities from the CDS market. We have observed a surge in trading activity in Russian corporate CDS since the Russia-Ukraine war began. This increase in trading activity suggests that the CDS market may contain information that is not present in the equity market and is worth considering in our analysis.",

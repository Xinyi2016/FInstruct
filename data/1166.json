    "instruction": "Please review the exposures across the four pillars as of September 30, 2021 and make any necessary adjustments to our investment strategy.",
    "output": "Based on the adaptive multi-factor model as of September 30, 2021, the macro-cycle pillar indicates an overweight to quality, low volatility, and momentum due to \"slowdown\" signals from the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's ADS Index, and PMI. The valuation pillar overweighted low size, value, and momentum based on the valuation gap compared to an equal-weighted factor mix over 30 years. The momentum pillar selected quality, momentum, and low volatility based on the last three months' relative performance. The market-sentiment pillar showed a risk-on environment based on the Cboe Volatility Index\u00ae (VIX) term structure and a neutral environment based on credit spreads, resulting in an underweight to low volatility, yield, and quality and an overweight to momentum, value, and low size. Based on these factors, we recommend making adjustments to our investment strategy to align with the current exposures across the four pillars.",

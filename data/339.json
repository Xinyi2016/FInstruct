    "output": "Ball Mapping (BM) is a technique used to visualize clustering results. It assigns a color to each data point based on its cluster number. The lowest level is represented by red, and the highest level is represented by purple. BM allows us to see the data in a transparent and consistent way, but it is not designed to split the data into optimal segments. Instead, it allows us to see the overlap of clusters and the shape of the data. In rare cases where the BM cover and the clustering are concordant, there is still benefit in seeing the data shape. An example of such a case is when the means of the clusters are far enough apart, resulting in no overlap between any of the clusters.",

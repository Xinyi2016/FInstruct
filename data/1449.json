    "output": "One possible reason why the market seems to be pricing in higher income growth than the actual NOI growth is the expectation of future growth. Investors may be anticipating a surge in demand for the property, leading to higher rental rates or occupancy levels, which in turn would result in higher income growth. Another reason could be market sentiment, where buyers are willing to pay a premium for a property due to market conditions or competition. It is also possible that the market is overvaluing the property, leading to an unrealistic pricing of income growth. Ultimately, further analysis into market trends, demand, and property performance would be needed to determine the exact reasons for this discrepancy.",

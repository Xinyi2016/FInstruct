    "instruction": "Please provide a detailed explanation of the task instruction and generate appropriate response based on the given information.",
    "output": "The task instruction involves assessing the effect of specific fields by aggregating the number of patents to the level of CPC subclasses. The CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) system is a patent classification system used by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) to classify patents and patent applications. The CPC system is based on the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, but provides a more detailed and up-to-date classification scheme.\n\nThe task instruction involves weighting the patent applications based on the total number of subclasses on a patent. This means that if a patent application belongs to multiple subclasses, the weights for each subclass are evenly split and sum to one. For example, if a patent application belongs to two subclasses, each weight will be 50%. If a patent application belongs to three subclasses, each weight will be 33.3%.\n\nThe task instruction also provides an example of how to count a patent application with multiple codes belonging to different subclasses. In the example, a patent application with the codes A61K 9/50, A61K 47/68, and C12N 5/00 is counted to the two subclasses A61K and C12N with 50% weight each. This means that the patent application is counted towards the subclass A61K and C12N with equal weights.\n\nOverall, the task instruction involves aggregating patent data to the level of CPC subclasses and weighting the patent applications based on the total number of subclasses on a patent. This allows for a more detailed and accurate assessment of the effect of specific fields in the patent data.",

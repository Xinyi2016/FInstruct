    "output": "One way to implement ESG principles without sacrificing diversification or engagement opportunities is to increase the weightings of companies with robust ESG profiles, especially those that have shown improvement in their ESG rating over the most recent 12 months. This approach can allow investment in a broad, diversified stock universe while still providing space for institutional investors to engage with poor ESG performers. However, the first challenge is to establish a core group of excluded stocks. After consulting with other large asset owners, it has been identified that consensus exists around excluding only the worst ESG performers, based on their involvement in controversial weapons and violations of international norms. The second challenge is weighting the remaining stocks. The MSCI ESG Universal Index designed to represent the performance of such a strategy, can tilt weights towards companies that have strong current ESG profiles or are improving their ESG performance. The backtested performance of the MSCI ESG Universal index has shown superior risk-return characteristics with a 1% tracking error over a simulated seven-year period. Therefore, this strategy not only allows large asset owners to incorporate their ESG goals into their investment strategy, but it also produced an ESG profile that is superior to the parent benchmark index.",

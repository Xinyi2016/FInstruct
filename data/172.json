    "instruction": "Describe the rationale behind choosing the three states (Odisha, Maharashtra, and Eastern UP) for the study.",
    "output": "The study chose Odisha, Maharashtra, and Eastern UP as the three states to be included in the sample due to several reasons. Firstly, these states are located in different parts of India, with Maharashtra in the west, Odisha in the east, and UP in the northern part. This geographical diversity allowed for a more representative sample of the country as a whole. Secondly, each of these states has a different predominant language-based ethnic group, which provided a diverse sample in terms of cultural background. Thirdly, these states have experienced different historical types of administrative and land-revenue systems during the colonial period, which have been shown to affect post-colonial institutions and economic outcomes. Finally, the presence of left-wing extremist (LWE) activities in some parts of each of these states was another factor in their selection, as measuring the institutional impacts of LWE politics on rural household outcomes was one of the research goals.",

    "output": "The process of generating synthetic asset returns using the TimeGAN algorithm involves the following steps:\n\n1. The TimeGAN is trained with default parameters as in Yoon et al. (2019) using block sizes of 6 months to capture both correlation and serial correlation aspects of the (joint) time series.\n2. Actual price data is converted to returns prior to being used as input.\n3. Once trained, the TimeGAN is used to generate a set of n=106n=10^{6}n=10^6 paths of synthetic asset returns, which is used as the training data set to train the NNs corresponding to the MCV, MSemiV and OSQ-optimal investment strategies.",
